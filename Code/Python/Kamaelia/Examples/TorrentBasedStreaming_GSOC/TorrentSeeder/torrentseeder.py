==============================================
Torrent Seeder
==============================================

The user specifies a file to which they own the copyright that they wish
to share using BitTorrent. This example creates a .torrent
(BitTorrent metadata) file for that file and seeds it.

Enter a filename to the console, e.g.
>>> mycreativecommonssong.ogg

NOTE: The file whose name you give MUST be in the local directory
otherwise it will not be found for seeding.

How does it work?
-----------------
TorrentMaker reads the contents of the file whose path is entered by the user.
It creates a .torrent file which contains cryptographic hashes of the source
file and enough information to distribute it using BitTorrent (provided a
central 'tracker' server is available to tell peers who has the file).

TorrentPatron then seeds the source file.
i.e. it uploads it to any clients that request it.
Send others your .torrent file so they can download from you and later upload
your file to others.

Usage
-----
First enter the announce URL of your BitTorrent tracker,
e.g. http://myserver.example.org:6969/announce
Then enter the names of files you wish to seed (they must be
in the local directory). For each of these, a .torrent file
will be created. With a copy of this file, other users
can download from you.
