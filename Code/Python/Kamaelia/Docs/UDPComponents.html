<p><span style="font-weight:600">UDP Components</span> trying to implement into the existing framework</p>
<p>Stacked Issues:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Selector constantly sends the UDP socket handler that there is data ready to be recieved. This is probably wrong.</li>
<li>VCSA now knows the destination address. This means it now has different behaviour from the CSA and internal state. Logically this can be resolved by transformation into a connection. That way (tcp) socket and (socket,address) can both be connections.</li>
<li>Virtual Connected Socket Adaptor needs to know the address to send the data to, because it's a virtual connection, not a real one:</li>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">def _safesend(sock, data,addr):<br />   &quot;&quot;&quot;Internal only function, used for sending data, and handling EAGAIN style<br />   retry scenarios gracefully&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />   try:<br />      sock.sendto(data,addr)<br />      return 1</span></div></ul>
<div></div>
<div>Needs to be more like:</div>
<ul type="disc"><li>To be written</li>
<div></div></ul></ul>
<p>OK, that aside...</p>
