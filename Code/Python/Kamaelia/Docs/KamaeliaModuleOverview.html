<p><span style="font-size:24pt;font-weight:600">Modules Overview</span></p>
<p>This file provides an overview of the current Kamaelia files, what they are and where appropriate, how they work. This is designed to be a living document, but not designed as raw API documentation. (There are better ways of building API documentation) Essentially the purpose of this documentis to act as &quot;the next layer up&quot; the documentation layers - stating how and why the different parts are joined together.</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Base Modules</li>
<li>Internet Adaption Modules</li>
<li>Network Protocol Modules</li>
<li>UDP Components</li>
<li>Utility Modules</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Base Modules</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- __init__.py</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- KamaeliaExceptions.py<br />|-- KamaeliaIPC.py</span></div></ul>
<p>The purpose of <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is as usual to allow the kamaelia modules to be imported in the traditional manner. It is empty however, so explicit naming of submodules is needed after import. </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">KamaeliaExceptions.py</span> contains a number of exceptions covering different potential failure points in the modules. These exceptions generally inherit from <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AxonException</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">KamaeliaIPC.py</span> however defines some specific payloads for intercomponent communication. These are generally control messages used by various Internet Adaption components for signalling various events - normally relating to new or closed socket events. The IPC messages inherit from <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Axon.IPC</span>, and are mainly notify events. Currently the only <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished </span>class is <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">socketShutdown </span>- issued by Internet Abstraction Modules.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Internet Adaption Modules</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- Internet.<br />|   |-- __init__.py<br />|   |-- socketConstants.py</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|   |-- TCPServer.py</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|   |-- TCPClient.py</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|   |-- ConnectedSocketAdapter.py</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|   |-- Selector.py</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|   |-- InternetConnection.py<br />|   `-- InternetHandlingTests.py<br /><br /></span></div></ul>
<p>These modules provide the basic primitives relating to network handling. Essentially the</p>
<p>purpose of each file defines a basic primitive in a normal network system. </p>
<p>As with the base Kamaelia package, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is empty and simply exists to allow package import as follows:</p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">import Kamaelia.Internet</span></div></ul>
<p>Clearly <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">socketConstants.py</span> contains a bunch of common constants - these aren't provided by the socket module and largely cover error conditions, and are defined to increase code readability.</p>
<p>The internet abstraction primitives can divided thus:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Connection Factories</li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPServer.py</span> acts as a factory spawning new connections which are handled by their own components and will often have a protocol handler associated with this.</li>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPClient.py</span> also acts as a factory, but only spawns one connected socket. It acts as a data passthrough proxy for the subcomponent.</li></ul>
<div></div>
<div>Neither connection factory <span style="font-style:italic">directly </span>handles any data to/from a connected socket.</div>
<div></div>
<li>Specific Socket Handling:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter.py</span> manages any connected socket.</li>
<ul type="circle"><li>Any data recieved on its <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">DataSend</span> inbox is sent to the socket in a non-blocking fashion, and any data recieved from the socket in a non-blocking fashion, is sent to the component outbox <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">outbox</span>. </li>
<li>It only attempts to get data from the socket when it recieves an appropriate message on its <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">dataReady</span> inbox.</li>
<li>When it recieves a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span> message on its control port after having sent all outstanding <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">dataSend</span> messages, it goes into a shutdown mode. This results in shutdown messages being sent to the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FactoryFeedback</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">signal</span> outboxes. This is due to the <span style="font-style:italic">ownership </span>of the connected sockets being elsewhere.</li></ul>
<div>This simplicity allows the to be used <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter</span> by both the connection factories.</div></ul>
<li>Multiple socket handling.</li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Selector.py</span> is designed for dealing with checking to see if any network connections are active, and which <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConnectedSocketAdapter</span>s need to be told they can/should attempt to recieve data. When it detects a server socket has a connection ready to be accepted it simply sends a message to a dynamically allocated outbox to send the appropriate <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">TCPServer</span> factory a message to tell it to accept the connection. </li>
<div>In practice server sockets and data sockets are treated pretty much the same way - the difference of interpretation is handled by the socket adaptor or the factory. Whilst it hasn't been written this allows the &quot;select&quot; based implementation of <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Selector</span> to be replaced by a polling approach without many code changes. (Indeed this could easily be done on the fly)</div></ul>
<li>Other code:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li> <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">InternetConnection.py</span> is legacy code and due to be ditched</li>
<li> <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">InternetHandlingTests.py</span> is the current test code being used to drive integration between client/server/selector service. This is a relatively complex example:</li>
<ul type="disc"><li>It creates a SimpleServer running and EchoProtocol, and a client running an EchoCheckerProtocolComponent, and a TCPClient. The EchoCheckerProtocolComponent is wired in to handle the application communications. The client connects to the server making a complete loop.</li></ul></ul></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Network Protocol Modules</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- Protocol.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|   |-- __init__.py<br />|   |-- AudioCookieProtocol.py<br />|   |-- EchoProtocolComponent.py<br />|   |-- FortuneCookieProtocol.py<br />|   |-- HTTPServer.py<br />|   |-- SimpleVideoCookieServer.py</span></div></ul>
<p>This directory contains a collection of modules, each implementing a simple of not so simple network protocol. Some of this are designed as toy protocols and were used during the design of the system to flesh out key areas. As before, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is simply an empty file.</p>
<p>The only protocol here with a potential to be non-trivial is the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">HTTPServer.py</span> protocol. The implementation inside that component at this point in time is deliberately very simplistic, and only implements a very simple very small subset of HTTP/1.0. When run standalone it runs a simple webserver on port 8082, sending random files to the client. The server code isn't actually complete. Also note that this is an <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:600">extremely </span><span style="font-style:italic">insecure </span>web server as a result of these two facts.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">EchoProtocolComponent.py</span> is the simplest protocol implemented, and was unsurprisingly the first one to be implemented - since it forms a simple loopback protocol useful for integration testing. In practice this component is really a <span style="font-style:italic">data pass through </span>component since all data recieved on its inbox is passed on directly to its outbox. As a result this component's implementation may actually migrate out to <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.Util</span> as a simple buffer component and allow this actual protocol component to simply inherit from <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.Util</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span> is one step above <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">EchoProtocolComponent.py</span>. It runs the fortune program on the server and sends the result to its outbox. In a networked environment what this means is the server will simply blat the fortune cookie to a client that connects to the server.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AudioCookieProtocol.py</span> is a logical extension to <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span>. Similar to <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span> it too runs an external program and sends the result to its outbox. In this case however rather than a short piece of text, it is a short snippet of audio. </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">SimpleVideoCookieServer.py</span> does essentially the same as <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">FortuneCookieProtocol.py</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AudioCookieProtocol.py</span>, but this time with a short piece of video.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Utility Modules</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- Util.<br />|   |-- __init__.py<br />|   |-- ToStringComponent.py<br />|   `-- ConsoleEcho.py</span></div></ul>
<p>This is a small collection of utility components. They're designed as simple filters for various uses - some perform simple, but useful transformations that convert data into a format suitable for other components, others are designed to be dropped in the middle of existing linkages to allow debugging and/or output.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">__init__.py</span> is as usual an empty file for the usual reasons.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ConsoleEcho.py</span> is designed to allow the system to take any data given on its inbox and send it to stdout. It can also optionally forward the data recieved to it's outbox meaning that it can be dropped in the middle of a linkage to enable precise debugging when you wish to know what communications is taking place.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">ToStringComponent.py </span>is a simple filter component  - it takes every object supplied via its inbox, calls <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">str()</span> on the object, and forwards the result to its outbox. This allows, for example, a user to take the output of any component, convert it to a string suitable for output to a console. This doesn't require the console component to do the conversion (since someone may wish to send the objects to a console as an easy way to check types), and doesn't require components to provide special behaviour.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-size:13pt;font-weight:600">Multimedia Modules</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">Kamaelia.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- AOPlayer.py </span><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-weight:600">deprecated</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">|-- vorbisDecodeComponent.py<br />`-- oggFilePlayComponent.py </span><span style="font-family:Century Schoolbook L;font-style:italic;font-weight:600">deprecated</span></div></ul>
<p>These three files are all related to the same purpose - playback of audio, and also decoding ogg vorbis. There are some restrictions on some of these, and there is a recommendation on which ones to use. Each of these requires a set of libraries - these are covered below.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOPlayer.py</span> is deprecated, the actual component has moved location, and you really ought not to use this at the moment. This may change at some point in time.</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Requires <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span>, and the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyao</span> python bindings.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggFilePlayComponent.py </span>is the oldest piece of code that can be used for decode and playback. It uses the official xiph python bindings to decode ogg vorbis. On the surface this is useful and if all you want to do is decode audio from a file, this does work. </p>
<ul type="disc"><li>There is a key restriction - it MUST come from a file object that you have opened. It can't be something that looks like a file, it must be a file. The reason for this is internally the xiph bindings dive into the file object supplied, pull out the C filehandle and pass that over to <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span>. </li>
<div>This imposes some awkward restrictions on your code. This does also mean that the operation of your codebecomes subserviant to the library, rather than the library subserviant to your code.</div>
<li>Requires the following libraries: <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libogg</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbis</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span></li>
<li>Requires the following python bindings: <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyogg</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyvorbis</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">pyao</span></li></ul>
<p>This file contains the following components:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggPlayer</span> - legacy component - you used to be able to choose between AOPlayer and  </li>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">PlayerComponent</span> - This is an abstract class that provides the main functionality of a player. Is is overridden by client subclasses. Subclasses are only expect to override the <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">write</span> method. The key method in the payer component is a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">play</span> generator. Nastily, this generator calls <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">VorbisFile</span> to enable file reading, unpacking of ogg and decode.</li>
<div>Current concrete subclasses:</div>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOPlayer</span> - This simply provides a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">write</span> method to send audio to a <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span> audio device.</li></ul></ul>
<p>It's worth noting that the execution here is pretty ugly, and it was the motivation for writing the next file. However, if all you want is to use <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbisfile</span>, <span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">oggFilePlayComponent.py</span> can be useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">vorbisDecodeComponent.py</span> was written to overcome the limitations metioned above. Specifically this provides 2 components - one that will accept ogg vorbis data on an inbox and provide back raw decoded audio on its outbox, and another that takes audio on its inbox and plays the audio. This provides much cleaner separation. The<span style="font-family:Cursor"> testing spike included shows how to use a file reading component in conjuction with these two components to provide a file reading/decode chain. </span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Cursor">The two components provided are:</span></li>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">VorbisDecode</span><span style="font-family:Cursor"> - takes ogg vorbis encoded audio from its inbox and provides raw decoded audio on its outbox. <br />Important note: This is currently ogg vorbis - as you would read from a file, NOT just vorbis encoded data.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor</span><span style="font-family:Cursor"> - takes raw audio recieved on its inbox and sends it to the audio device. Currently this may well be a blocking operation. How to do this in a non-blocking manner is under investigation. If it recieves a </span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">producerFinished</span><span style="font-family:Cursor"> message on its control inbox, this component exits.</span></li></ul></ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Cursor">These components rely on the following libraries being installed:</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libogg</span><span style="font-family:Cursor">, </span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libao</span><span style="font-family:Cursor">, </span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbis</span><span style="font-family:Cursor">, </span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbissimple</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Cursor">The python bindings required are:</span></p>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style="font-family:Cursor">The python bindings supplied with </span><span style="font-family:Courier 10 Pitch">libvorbissimple</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Cursor">Pyrex is therefore also required.</span></li></ul>
