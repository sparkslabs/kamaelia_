=========================
Kamaelia IRC Support Code
=========================

This provides support for Kamaelia.Protocol.IRC.*

Specifically it provides 2 core functions and 2 utility methods.



Core functions
--------------

informat(text,defaultChannel='#kamtest')
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary - Puts a string input into tuple format for IRC_Client. Understands
irc commands preceded by a slash ("/"). All other text is formatted such
that sending it would send the message to the default channel.

Detail - If the text starts with a "/" it is treated as a command. Informat
understands some specific commands which it helps you format for sending to
the IRCClient. The commands it understands are::

       QUIT
       PRIVMSG
       MSG
       NOTICE
       KILL
       TOPIC
       SQUERY
       KICK
       USER
       ME

For commands it doesn't recognise, it makes a guess at how to forward it.

If you send it text which does NOT start with "/", it is assumed to be badly
formatted text, intended to be sent to the current default channel. It is
then formatted appropriately for sending on to an IRC_Client component.

For an example of usage, see Examples/TCP_Systems/IRC/BasicDemo.py



outformat(data, defaultChannel='#kamtest')
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Takes tuple output from IRC_Client and formats for easier reading  If a
plaintext is received, outformat treats it as a privmsg intended for
defaultChannel (default "#kamtest").

Specific commands it understands and will make a an attempt to format
appropriately are::

        PRIVMSG
        JOIN
        PART
        NICK
        ACTION
        TOPIC
        QUIT
        MODE

It will also identify certain types of errors.

For an example of usage, see Examples/TCP_Systems/IRC/BasicDemo.py



Utility functions
-----------------

channelOutformat(channel)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a customised outformat function with defaultChannel predefined to
channel. (ie Returns a lambda)


channelInformat(channel)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creates a customised informat function with defaultChannel predefined to
channel. (ie Returns a lambda)



Open Issues
-----------

Should these really be components rather than helper functions?
