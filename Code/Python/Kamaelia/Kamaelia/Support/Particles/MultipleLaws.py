Particle Physics Laws for multiple particles
============================================

A class implementing laws for interactions between multiple particle types,  in
discrete time simulations. Can be used with the physics ParticleSystem class.
This implementation supports different parameters for interactions between
different particle types.

You specify a mapping between pairs of types of particles and the set of laws
to apply between them.

This class provides the same methods as the SimpleLaws class. It is a drop in
replacement for when you wish to specialise a physics model to apply different
laws depending on the types of particles involved.



Example Usage
-------------

For two types of particle "Entity" and "Attribute":
- Entities only repel each other
- Attributes bond at a distance of 200 units
- Attributes bond to entities at a distance of 50 units
::

    mapping = { ("Entity","Entity") :SimpleLaws(maxBondForce=0, repulsionStrength=10),
                ("Attribute","Attribute") : SimpleLaws(bondLength=200),
                ("Entity","Attribute") : SimpleLaws(bondLength=50),
              }
        
    laws = MultipleLaws( typesToLaws=mapping,
                       )



How does it work?
-----------------

It provides the same method interface as the SimpleLaws class, but applies
different sets of laws depending on the particle types passed when methods are
called (SimpleLaws always applies the same rules irrespective).

The different laws provided are stored with the specified mappings.
If you specify a mapping for (typeA,typeB), then it will also be applied to
(typeB,typeA). You do not need to specify the mappings both ways round, though
you may if you wish.

If you do not specify the complete set of mappings for the particle types to
all of each other, then a default law (if specified) will be used to fill in
the gaps.

Note that the default law does not get applied to particle types not mentioned
when in the mappings you provide. For example, if your mappings only cover
particle types 'A','B', and 'C', then interactions involving a new type 'D' will
cause an exception to be raised.

The 'maximum interaction radius' for a given particle type is set to the maximum
of the interaction radii for all the different interaction laws it is involved
in.
