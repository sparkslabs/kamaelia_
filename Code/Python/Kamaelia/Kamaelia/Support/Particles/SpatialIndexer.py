Fast spatial indexing of entities
=================================

A SpatialIndexer object is an index of entities that provides fast lookups of
entities whose coordinates are within a specified radius of a specified point.
You can have as many, or few, spatial dimensions as you like.

This is particularly useful for computationally intensive tasks such as
calculating interactions between particles as performed, for example, by the
Particle and ParticleSystem classes.



Example Usage
-------------

Creating and index and registering two entities with it at (1,2) and (12,34).
We also tell the SpatialIndexer that the 'usual' radius we'll be searching over
is 5 units::

    >>> class Entity:
    ...   def __init__(self, coords):
    ...     self.coords = coords
    ...   def getLoc(self):
    ...     return self.coords
    ...
    >>> index = SpatialIndexer(proxDist=5.0)
    >>> a = Entity((1.0, 2.0))
    >>> b = Entity((12.0, 34.0))
    >>> index.add(a,b)
    
Only 'a' is within 10 units of (0,0)::
    
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 10.0) == [(a,5.0)]
    True

The returned tuples are of the form: (entity, distance-squared)

Neither point is within 1 unit of (0,0)::

    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 1.0)
    []

Both 'a' and 'b' are within 50 units of (0,0)::
    
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 50.0) == [(a,5.0), (b,1300)]
    True

We can ask the same, but request that 'a' be excluded::
    
    >>> filter = lambda particle : particle != a
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 50.0, filter) == [(b,1300)]
    True

If we remove 'a' then only 'b' will be found::
    
    >>> index.remove(a)
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 50.0) == [(b, 1300.0)]
    True

If we change the position of b we must *notify* the SpatialIndexer::
    
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 10.0) == []
    True
    >>> b.coords=(5.0,6.0)
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 10.0) == [(b, 61.0)]
    False
    >>> index.updateLoc(b)
    >>> index.withinRadius((0,0), 10.0) == [(b, 61.0)]
    True



How does it work?
-----------------

SpatialIndexer stores entities in an associative data structure, indexed by
their spatial location. Simply put, it breaks space into a grid of cells. The
coordinates of that cell index into a dictionary. All particles that fall within
a given cell are stored in a list in that dictionary entry.

It can then rapidly search for cells overlapping the area we want to search and
return those entities that fall within that area.

The size of the cells is specified during initialisation. Choose a size roughly
equal to the radius you'll most often be searching over. Too small a value will
case SpatialIndexer to spend too long enumerating through cells. To big a cell
size and far more entities will be searched that necessary.

Entities must provide a getLoc() method that returns a tuple of the coordinates
of that entity.

Use the add(...) and remove(...) methods to register and deregister entities
from the spatial index.

If you change the coordinates of an entity, the SpatialIndexer must be notified
by calling its updateLoc(...) method.
