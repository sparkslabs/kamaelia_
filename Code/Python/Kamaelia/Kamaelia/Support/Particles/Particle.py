Particle in a discrete time physics simulation
===============================================

The Particle class provides the basis for particles in a ParticleSystem
simulation. The particles handle their own physics interaction calculations.
You can have as many, or few, spatial dimensions as you like.

Extend this base class to add extra functionality, such as the ability to render
to a graphics display (see RenderingParticle for an example of this)



Example Usage
-------------
See ParticleSystem



How does it work?
-----------------

Particle maintains lists of other particles it is bonded to. The bonds have
direction, so the bonding information is stored in two lists - bondedTo and
bondedFrom.

Bonds are made and broken by calling the makeBond(...), breakBond(...) and
breakAllBonds(...) methods.

Particle calculates its interactions with other particles when the
doInteractions(...) method is called. This must be supplied with an object
containins the laws to apply, and another providing the ability to search for
particles within a given distance of a point. See SimpleLaws/MultipleLaws and
SpatialIndexer respectively. This updates the velocity of the particle but not
its actual position.

The particle's position is only updated when the update(...) method is called.

A simulation system should calculate each simulation cycle as a two step
process: First, for all particles, calling doInteractions(...). Second, for all
particles, calling update(...).

A particle can be frozen in place by calling freeze() and unFreeze(). This
forces the particle's velocity to zero, meaning it doesn't move because of
interactions with other particles.

The simulation must have a 'tick' counter, whose value changes (increments)
every simulation cycle. Particle stores the last tick value it was presented
with so that, when interacting with other particles, it can see which others
have already been processed in the current cycle. This way, it avoids
accidentaly calculating some interactions twice.

    Bonds are bi-directional. Establishing a bond from A to B, will also establish it back from B to A.
    Similarly, breaking the bond will do so in both directions too.
