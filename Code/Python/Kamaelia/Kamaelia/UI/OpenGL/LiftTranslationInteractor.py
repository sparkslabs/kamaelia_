Lift Translation Interactor
===========================

An interactor for moving OpenGLComponents corresponding to mouse
movement along the X,Y plane. When "grabbing" an object it is lifted by
a specified amount.

LiftTranslationInteractor is a subclass of Interactor.

Example Usage
-------------
The following example shows four SimpleCubes which can be moved by
dragging your mouse::

    o1 = SimpleCube(position=(6, 0,-30), size=(1,1,1), name="center").activate()
    i1 = LiftTranslationInteractor(target=o1).activate()

    o2 = SimpleCube(position=(0, 0,-30), size=(1,1,1), name="center").activate()
    i2 = LiftTranslationInteractor(target=o2).activate()

    o3 = SimpleCube(position=(-3, 0,-30), size=(1,1,1), name="center").activate()
    i3 = LiftTranslationInteractor(target=o3).activate()

    o4 = SimpleCube(position=(15, 0,-30), size=(1,1,1), name="center").activate()
    i4 = LiftTranslationInteractor(target=o4).activate()

    Axon.Scheduler.scheduler.run.runThreads()  

How does it work?
-----------------
LiftTranslationInteractor is a subclass of Interactor. It overrides
the __ini__(), setup(), handleEvents() and frame() methods.

The matched movement works by using the position of the controlled
object and determine its X,Y-aligned plane. The amount of mouse movement
is then calculated as if it was on this plane. This is done by
intersecting the direction vector which is included in the mouse event
with the plane to get the point of intersection. Then the distance
between the newly generated point and the last point is calculated. The
result is the actual amount of movement along the X and the Y axis.

The interactor makes all the linkages it needs during initialisation.
Because the interactor needs the actual position of the controlled
component to be accurate all the time, it uses the components "position"
outbox by default. If you don't want the interactor to make the
linkages, you can set nolink=True as constructor argument. The following
linkages are needed for the interactor to work (from the interactors
point of view)::

    self.link( (self, "outbox"), (self.target, "rel_position") )
    self.link( (self.target, "position"), (self, "inbox") )
