Pygame Display Access
=====================

This component provides a pygame window. Other components can request to be
notified of events, or ask for a pygame surface or video overlay that will be
rendered onto the display.

Pygame Display is a service that registers with the Coordinating Assistant
Tracker (CAT).



Example Usage
-------------

See the Button component or VideoOverlay component for examples of how
Pygame Display can be used.

    

How does it work?
-----------------

Pygame Display is a service. obtain it by calling the
PygameDisplay.getDisplayService(...) static method. Any existing instance
will be returned, otherwise a new one is automatically created.

Alternatively, if you wish to configure Pygame Display with options other than
the defaults, create your own instance, then register it as a service by
calling the PygameDisplay.setDisplayService(...) static method. NOTE that it
is only advisable to do this at the top level of your system, as other
components may have already requested and created a Pygame Display component!

pygame only supports one display window at a time, you must not make more than
one Pygame Display component.

Pygame Display listens for requests arriving at its "notify" inbox. A request can
be to:
- create or destroy a surface,
- listen or stop listening to events (you must have already requested a surface)
- move an existing surface
- create a video overlay
- notify of ne to redraw

The requests are described in more detail below.

Once your component has been given the requested surface, it is free to render
onto it whenever it wishes. It should then immediately send a "REDRAW" request
to notify Pygame Display that the window needs redrawing.


NOTE that you must set the alpha value of the surface before rendering and
restore its previous value before yielding. This is because Pygame Display uses
the alpha value to control the transparency with which it renders the surface.

Overlays work differently: instead of being given something to render to, you
must provide, in your initial request, an outbox to which you will send raw
yuv (video) data, whenever you want to change the image on the overlay.

Pygame Display instantiates a private, threaded component to listen for pygame
events. These are then forwarded onto Pygame Display.

Pygame Display's main loop continuously renders the surfaces and video overlays
onto the display, and dispatches any pygame events to listeners. The rendering
order is as follows:
- background fill (default=white)
- surfaces (in the order they were requested and created)
- video overlays (in the order they were requested and created)

In summary, to use a surface, your component should:
1. Obtain and wire up to the "notify" inbox of the Pygame Display service
2. Request a surface
3. Render onto that surface in its main loop

And to use overlays, your component should:
1. Obtain and wire up to the "notify" inbox of the Pygame Display service
2. Request an overlay, providing an outbox
3. Send yuv data to the outbox 

This component does not terminate. It ignores any messages arriving at its
"control" inbox and does not send anything out of its "outbox" or "signal"
outboxes.


Surfaces
^^^^^^^^
To request a surface, send a dictionary to the "notify" inbox. The following
keys are mandatory::

    {
        "DISPLAYREQUEST" : True,               # this is a 'new surface' request
        "size" : (width,height),               # pixels size for the new surface
        "callback" : (component, "inboxname")  # to send the new surface object to
    }

These keys are optional::

    {
        "position" : (left,top)                # location of the new surface in the window (default=arbitrary)
        "alpha" : 0 to 255,                    # alpha of the surface (255=opaque) (default=255)
        "transparency" : (r,g,b),              # colour that will appear transparent (default=None)
        "events" : (component, "inboxname"),   # to send event notification to (default=None)
    }

To deregister your surface, send a producerFinished(surface) message to the
"notify" inbox. Where 'surface' is your surface. This will remove your surface
and deregister any events you were listening to.

To change the position your surface is rendered at, send a dictionary to the
"notify" inbox containing the folling keys::

    {
        "CHANGEDISPLAYGEO" : True,             # this is a 'change geometry' request
        "surface" : surface,                   # the surface to affect
        "position" : (left,top)                # new location for the surface in the window
    }

The "surface" and "position" keys are optional. However if either are not
specified then there will be no effect!


Listening to events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once your component has obtained a surface, it can request to be notified
of specific pygame events.

To request to listen to a given event, send a dictionary to the "notify" inbox,
containing the following::

    {
        "ADDLISTENEVENT" : pygame_eventtype,     # example: pygame.KEYDOWN
        "surface" : your_surface,
    }

To unsubscribe from a given event, send a dictionary containing::

    {
        "REMOVELISTENEVENT" : pygame_eventtype,
        "surface" : your_surface,
    }
    
Events will be sent to the inbox specified in the "events" key of the
"DISPLAYREQUEST" message. They arrive as a list of pygame event objects.

NOTE: If the event is MOUSEMOTION, MOUSEBUTTONUP or MOUSEBUTTONDOWN then you
will instead receive a replacement object, with the same attributes as the
pygame event, but with the 'pos' attribute adjusted so that (0,0) is the top
left corner of *your* surface.


Video Overlays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To request an overlay, send a dictionary to the "notify" inbox. The following
keys are mandatory::

    {
        "OVERLAYREQUEST" : True,                      # this is a 'new overlay' request
        "size" : (width,height),                      # pixels size of the overlay
        "pixformat" : pygame_pixformat,               # example: pygame.IYUV_OVERLAY
    }

These keys are optional::

    {
        "position" : (left,top),                      # location of the overlay (default=(0,0))
        "yuv" : (ydata,udata,vdata),                  # first frame of yuv data
        "yuvservice" : (component,"outboxname"),      # source of future frames of yuv data
        "positionservice" : (component,"outboxname"), # source of changes to the overlay position
    }

"yuv" enables you to provide the first frame of video data. It should be 3
strings, containing the yuv data for a whole frame.

If you have supplied a (component,outbox) pair as a "yuvservice" then any
(y,u,v) data sent to that outbox will update the video overlay. Again the data
should be 3 strings, containing the yuv data for a *whole frame*.

If you have supplied a "positionservice", then sending (x,y) pairs to the
outbox you specified will update the position of the overlay.

There is currently no mechanism to destroy an overlay.

Redraw requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To notify Pygame Display that it needs to redraw the display, send a dictionary
containing the following keys to the "notify" inbox::

    {
        "REDRAW" : True,             # this is a redraw request
        "surface" : surface          # surface that has been changed
    }



Implementation Details
----------------------

You may notice that this module also contains a _PygameEventSource component.
PygameDisplay uses this separate threaded component to notify it when pygame
events occur - so that it can sleep quiescently when it has nothing to do.

Unfortunately event handling itself cannot be done in the thread since pygame
on many platforms (particularly win32) does not work properly if event handling
and display creation is not done in the main thread of the program.
