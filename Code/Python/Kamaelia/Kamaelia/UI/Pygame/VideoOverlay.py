====================
Pygame Video Overlay
====================

Displays uncompressed video data on a pygame 'overlay' using the Pygame Display
service.



Example Usage
-------------

Read raw YUV data from a file and display it using VideoOverlay::

    imagesize = (352, 288)        # "CIF" size video
    fps = 15                      # framerate of video
    
    Pipeline(ReadFileAdapter("raw352x288video.yuv", ...other args...),
             RawYUVFramer(imagesize),
             MessageRateLimit(messages_per_second=fps, buffer=fps*2)
             VideoOverlay()
            ).activate()

RawYUVFramer is needed to frame raw YUV data into individual video frames.



How does it work?
-----------------

The component waits to receive uncompressed video frames from its "inbox" inbox.

The frames must be encoded as dictionary objects in the format described below.

When the first frame is received, the component notes the size and pixel format
of the video data and requests an appropriate 'overlay' surface from the
Pygame Display service component, to which video can be rendered.

NOTE: Currently the only supported pixelformat is "YUV420_planar".

NOTE: A fudge factor is currently applied to the video size (see below)

Included in the request is a reference to an outbox through which the component
will send the yuv video data for future frames of video. For video overlays,
the video data must be sent direct to the Pygame Display component rather than
be rendered onto an intermediate surface.

Also included in the request is the data for the first frame of video.

When subsequent frames of video are received the yuv data is sent to the
"yuvdata" outbox, which by now is linked to the Pygame Display component.

If the frame of video is of a different pixel format or size then VideoOverlay
will re-request a new overlay.

NOTE: If this happens, the component does NOT dispose of the old surface.
This behaviour should therefore be avoided at present - repeated changes of
video size/pixel format will result in multiple overlays accumulating in the
pygame display.


Fudge factor
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The size of overlay requested by the VideoOverlay component is adjusted by a
fudge factor.

This is a workaround for problems with  Xorg/fbdev based displays on linux. If
the overlay is precisely the right size and shape for the data, it can't be
displayed right. The value must be even, and preferably small. Odd values result
in the picture being sheared/slanted.

This problem rears itself when the following version numbers are aligned:
  
- SDL : 1.2.8
- pygame : Anything up to/including 1.7.1prerelease
- xorg : 6.8.2
- Linux (for fbdev) : 2.6.11.4

The fudge factor does not appear to adversely affect behaviour on other
system configurations.



=========================
UNCOMPRESSED FRAME FORMAT
=========================

Uncompresed video frames must be encoded as dictionaries. VidoeOverlay requires
the following entries::

    {
      "yuv" : (y_data, u_data, v_data)  # a tuple of strings
      "size" : (width, height)          # in pixels
      "pixformat" :  "YUV420_planar"    # format of raw video data
    }

#
#             Either the request for a new overlay must be suppressed, or the
#             old overlay should be destroyed. The latter will require support
