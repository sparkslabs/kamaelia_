Publishing and Subscribing with Backplanes
==========================================

Backplanes provide a way to 'publish' data under a name, enabling other parts
of the system to 'subscribe' to it on the fly, without having to know about the
actual component(s) the data is coming from.

It is a quick and easy way to distribute or share data. Think of them like
backplane circuit boards - where other circuit boards can plug in to send or
receive any signals they need.



Example usage
-------------

A system where several producers publish data, for consumers to pick up::

    Pipeline( Producer1(),
              PublishTo("DATA")
            ).activate()

    Pipeline( Producer2(),
              PublishTo("DATA")
            ).activate()

    Pipeline( SubscribeTo("DATA"),
              Consumer1(),
            ).activate()
            
    Pipeline( SubscribeTo("DATA"),
              Consumer2(),
            ).activate()
            
    Backplane("DATA").run()

A server where multiple clients can connect and they all get sent the same data
at the same time::
    
    Pipeline( Producer(),
              PublishTo("DATA")
            ).activate()

    SimpleServer(protocol=SubscribeTo("DATA"), port=1500).activate()

    Backplane("DATA").run()



More detail
-----------

The Backplane component collects data from publishers and sends it out to
subscribers.

You can have as many backplanes as you like in a running system - provided they
all register under different names.

A backplane can have multiple subscribers and multiple publishers. Publishers
and subscribers can be created and destroyed on the fly.

To shut down a PublishTo() component, send a producerFinished() or
shutdownMicroprocess() message to its "control" inbox. This does *not* propagate
and therefore does *not* cause the Backplane or any subscribers to terminate.

To shut down a SubscribeTo() component, send a producerFinished() or
shutdownMicroprocess() message to its "control" inbox. It will then immediately
forward the mesage on out of its "signal" outbox and terminate.

To shut down the Backplane itself, send a producerFinished() or
shutdownMicroprocess() message to its "control" inbox. It will then immediately
terminate and also propagate this message onto any subscribers (SubscribeTo
components), causing them to also terminate.



Implementation details
----------------------

Backplane is actually based on a Kamaelia.Util.Splitter.PlugSplitter component,
and the SubscribeTo component is a wrapper around a Kamaelia.Util.Splitter.Plug.

The Backplane registers itself with the coordinating assistant
tracker.
 
* Its "inbox" inbox is registered under the name "Backplane_I_<name>"
* Its "configuration" inbox is registered under the name "Backplane_O_<name>"

PublishTo components look up the "Backplane_I_<name>" service and simply forward
data sent to their "inbox" inboxes direct to the "inbox" inbox of the
PlugSplitter - causing it to be distributed to all subscribers.

SubscribeTo components look up the "Backplane_O_<name>" service and request to
have their "inbox" and "control" inboxes connected to the PlugSplitter.
SubscribeTo then forwards on any messages it receives out of its "outbox" and
"signal" outboxes respectively.

The PlugSplitter component's "control" inbox and "signal" outbox are not
advertised as services. To shut down a Backplane you must therefore send a
shutdownMicroprocess() or producerFinished() message directly to its "control"
inbox. When this happens, the shutdown message will be forwarded on to all
subscribers - causing SubscribeTo components to also shut down.
