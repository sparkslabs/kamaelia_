Filter items out that are not in range
======================================

RangeFilter passes through items received on its "inbox" inbox where item[0]
lies within one or more of a specfied set of ranges of value. Items that don't
match this are discarded.



Example Usage
-------------

Reading all video frames from a YUV4MPEG format video file, but only passing on
video frames 25-49 and 100-199 inclusive further along the pipeline::

    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myvideo.yuv4mpeg",readmode="bytes"),
              YUV4MPEGToFrame(),
              TagWithSequenceNumber(),
              RangeFilter(ranges=[ (25,49), (100,199) ]),
              ...
            ).run()



Behaviour
---------

At initialisation, specify a list of value ranges that RangeFilter should allow.
The list should be of the form::
    
    [ (low,high), (low,high), (low, high), ... ]
    
The ranges specified are inclusive.

Send an item to the "inbox" inbox of the form (value, ....). If the value 
matches one or more of the ranges specified, then the whole item (including the
value) will immediately be sent on out of the "outbox" outbox.

RangeFilter can therefore be used to select slices through sequence numbered or
timestamped data.

If the size limited inbox is full, this component will pause until it is able
to send out the data,.

If a producerFinished message is received on the "control" inbox, this component
will complete parsing any data pending in its inbox, and finish sending any
resulting data to its outbox. It will then send the producerFinished message on
out of its "signal" outbox and terminate.

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the "control" inbox, this
component will immediately send it on out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate. It will not complete processing, or sending on any pending data.
