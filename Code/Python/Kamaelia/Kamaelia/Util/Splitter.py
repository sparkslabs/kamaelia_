=========================
Simple Fanout of messages
=========================

A component that splits a data source, fanning it out to multiple destinations.



Example Usage
-------------

Component connecting to a Splitter::

    class Consumer(Axon.Component.component):
        Outboxes = [ "outbox", "signal", "splitter_config" ]
        
        def main(self):
             self.send( addsink( self, "inbox", "control" ), "splitter_config")
             yield 1
             ... do stuff when data is received on "inbox" inbox

    mysplitter = Splitter()
    Pipeline( producer(), mysplitter ).activate()
    
    myconsumer = Consumer().activate()
    myconsumer.link( (myconsumer, "splitter_config"), ("mysplitter", "configuration") )



How does it work?
-----------------

Any data sent to the component's "inbox" inbox is sent out to multiple
destinations (but not to the "outbox" outbox).

Add a destination by sending an addsink(...) message to the "configuration"
inbox of the component. Splitter will then wire up to the 'sinkbox' inbox
specified in the message, and send it any data sent to its "inbox" inbox.

NOTE: Splitter only does this for the 'sinkbox' inbox, not for the
'sinkcontrol' inbox. If one is specified, it is ignored.

There is no limit on the number of 'sinks' that can be connected to the
splitter. The same component can add itself as a sink multiple times, provided
different named inboxes are used each time.

NOTE: The data is not duplicated - the same item is sent to all destinations.
Care must therefore be taken if the data item is mutable.

If one or more destinations cause a noSpaceInBox exception, the data item will
be queued, and Splitter will attempt to resend it to the destinations in
question until successful. It will stop forwarding any new incoming data until
it has succeeded, thereby ensuring the order of data is not altered.

Stop data being sent to a destination by sending a removesink(...) message to
the "configuration" inbox of the Splitter component. Splitter will then cease
sending messages to the 'sinkbox' inbox specified in the message and will
unwire from it.

Any messages sent to the "control" inbox are ignored. The "outbox" and "signal"
outboxes are not used.

This component does not terminate.



============================
Pluggable Fanout of messages
============================

The PlugSplitter component splits a data source, fanning it out to multiple
destinations. The Plug component allows you to easily 'plug' a destination
into the splitter.



Example Usage
-------------

Two consumers receiving the same data from a single consumer. Producer and
consumers are encapsulated by PlugSplitter and Plug components respectively::

    mysplitter = PlugSplitter( producer() ).activate()
    
    Plug(mysplitter, consumer() ).activate()
    Plug(mysplitter, consumer() ).activate()
    
The same, but the producer and consumers are not encapsulated::

    mysplitter = PlugSplitter()
    Pipeline( producer, mysplitter ).activate()
    
    Pipeline( Plug(mysplitter), consumer() ).activate()
    Pipeline( Plug(mysplitter), consumer() ).activate()
    
    
    
How does it work?
-----------------

Any data sent to the component's "inbox" and "control" inboxes is sent out to
multiple destinations. It is also sent onto the components "outbox" and
"signal" outboxes, respectively.

Alternatively, initialisation you can specify a 'source' component. If you do,
then data to be sent out to multiple destinations is instead received from that
component's "outbox" and "signal" outboxes, respectively. Any data sent to the
"inbox" and "control" inboxes of the PlugSplitter component will be forwarded
to the "inbox" and "control" inboxes of the 'source' component, respectively.

This source component is encapsulated as a child within the PlugSplitter
component, and so must not be separately activated. Activating PlugSplitter
will also activate this child component.

Add a destination by making a Plug component, specifying the PlugSplitter
component to 'plug into'. See documentation for the Plug component for more
information.

Alternatively, you can add and remove destinations manually:

* Add a destination by sending an addsink(...) message to the "configuration"
  inbox of the component.
  
  If a 'sinkbox' inbox is specified in the message, then
  PlugSplitter will wire up to it and forward to it any 'inbox'/'outbox' data.
  If a 'sinkcontrol' inbox is specified, then Plugsplitter will wire up to it
  and forward to it any 'control'/'signal' data.
  
* Stop data being sent to a destination by sending a removesink(...) message to
  the "configuration" inbox of the Splitter component.
  
  Splitter will then cease
  sending messages to the 'sinkbox' inbox specified in the message and will
  unwire from it.

There is no limit on the number of 'sinks' that can be connected to the
splitter. The same component can add itself as a sink multiple times, provided
different named inboxes are used each time.

NOTE: The data is not duplicated - the same item is sent to all destinations.
Care must therefore be taken if the data item is mutable.

If a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished message is received on the 
"control" inbox and there is NO 'source' child component, then the message is
forwarded onto all 'control' destinations and the 'signal' outbox. The 
component then immediately terminates, unwiring from all destinations.

If there is a child component then PlugSplitter will terminate when the child
component terminates, unwiring from all destinations.



=====================
Plug for PlugSplitter
=====================

The Plug component 'plugs into' a PlugSplitter as a destination to which the
source data is split.



Example Usage
-------------
See PlugSplitter documentation.



How does it work?
-----------------

Initialise the Plug component by specifying a PlugSplitter component to connect
to and the component that wants to receive the data from the Plugsplitter.

The destination/sink component is encapsulated as a child component, and is
therefore activated by the Plug component when it is activated. Do not activate
it yourself.

The Plug component connects to the PlugSplitter component by wiring its
"splitter_config" outbox to the "configuration" inbox of the PlugSplitter
component and sending it an addsink(...) message. This causes PlugSplitter
to wire up to the Plug's "inbox" and "control" inboxes.

The Plug's "inbox" and "control" inboxes are forwarded to the "inbox" and
"control" inboxes of the child component respectively. The "outbox" and
"signal" outboxes of the child component are forwarded to the "outbox" and
"signal" outboxes of the Plug component respectively.

When the child component terminates, the Plug component sends a removesink(...)
message to the PlugSplitter, causing PlugSplitter to unwire from it. It then
terminates.




Thoughts
--------

PlugSplitter is probably more reliable than Splitter however it *feels* too
complex. However the actual "Splitter" class in this file is not the
preferable option.
