==========
Chunkifier
==========

A component that fixes the message size of an input stream to a given value,
outputting blocks of that size when sufficient input has accumulated. This
component's input is stream orientated - all messages received are
concatenated to the interal buffer without divisions.

Example Usage
-------------

Chunkifying a console reader::

    pipeline(
        ConsoleReader(eol=""),
        Chunkifier(20),
        ConsoleEchoer()
    ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

Messages received on the "inbox" are buffered until at least N bytes have
been collected. A message containing those first N bytes is sent out
"outbox". A CharacterFIFO object is used to do this in linear time.

The usual sending of a producerFinished/shutdown to the "control"
inbox will shut it down.
