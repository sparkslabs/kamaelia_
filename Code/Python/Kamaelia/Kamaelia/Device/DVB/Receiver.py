DVB-T (Digital Terrestrial TV) Tuner & Demuxing Service
=======================================================

Tunes to the specified frequency, using the specified parameters, using a DVB
tuner device; then demultiplexes packets by packet ID (PID) from DVB/MPEG
transport streams. Provides this as a service, to which other components can
subscribe as clients, requesting to receive packets with certain PIDs.

This is a prefab component built out of a Tuner and DemuxerService component.



Example Usage
-------------

(Using experimental Kamaelia.Experimental.Services components)

Set up receiver as a named public service, then subscribe to specific PIDs for
recording a stream and some event information::
    
    feparams = {
        "inversion" : dvb3.frontend.INVERSION_AUTO,
        "constellation" : dvb3.frontend.QAM_16,
        "code_rate_HP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
        "code_rate_LP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
    }
    
    RegisterService( Receiver(505.833330, feparams),
                     {"DEMUXER":"inbox"}
                   ).activate()
                   
    Pipeline( Subscribe("DEMUXER", [600,601]),
              SimpleFileWriter("recording_of_600_and_601.ts"),
            ).activate()
    
    Pipeline( Subscribe("DEMUXER", [18]),
              SimpleFileWriter("event_information_data.ts")
            ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

This component is a prefab combining a Tuner and a DemuxerService component.

Use this component in exactly the same way as you would use the
Kamaelia.Device.DVB.DemuxerService component. The only difference is that
requests should be sent to the "inbox" inbox, instead of a different one.

To request to be sent packets with particular PIDs, send messages of the form:

    ("ADD",    (dest_component, dest_inboxname), [pid, pid, ...])
    ("REMOVE", (dest_component, dest_inboxname), [pid, pid, ...])

For more details, see Kamaelia.Device.DVB.DemuxerService.

Internally, the DemuxerService component is wired so that its requests for PIDs
go straight back to the Tuner component. When a client makes a request, the
DemuxerService therefore automatically asks the Tuner to give it only the
packets it needs to satisfy all its current clients.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to the "control" inbox. The message will be forwarded on out of
the "signal" outbox just before termination.
