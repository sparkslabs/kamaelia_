================================
Video frame cropping and scaling
================================

This component applies a crop and/or scaling operation to frames of RGB video.

Requires PIL - the `python imaging library. <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_



Example Usage
-------------

Crop and scale a YUV4MPEG format uncompressed video file so that the output
is the region (100,100) ->(400,300), scaled up to 720x576::

    from Kamaelia.File.Reading import RateControlledFileReader

    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("input.yuv4mpeg", ... ),
              YUV4MPEGToFrame(),
              ToRGB_interleaved(),
              CropAndScale(newsize=(720,576), cropbounds=(100,100,400,300)),
              ToYUV420_planar(),
              FrameToYUV4MPEG(),
              SimpleFileWriter("cropped_and_scaled.yuv4mpeg"),
            ).run()



More details
------------

Initialise this component specifying the region of the incoming video frames
to crop to, and the size of the desired output (the cropped region will be
scaled up/down to match this).

Send frame data structures to the "inbox" inbox of this component. The frames
will be cropped and scaled and output from the "outbox" outbox. Only frames
with one of the following pixel formats are currently supported:
    
    "RGB_interleaved"
    "RGBA_interleaved"
    "Y_planar"

See below for a description of the uncompressed frame data structure format.
Send uncompressed video frames, in the format described below,

This component supports sending data out of its outbox to a size limited inbox.
If the size limited inbox is full, this component will pause until it is able
to send out the data. Data will not be consumed from the inbox if this component
is waiting to send to the outbox.

If a producerFinished message is received on the "control" inbox, this component
will complete parsing any data pending in its inbox, and finish sending any
resulting data to its outbox. It will then send the producerFinished message on
out of its "signal" outbox and terminate.

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the "control" inbox, this
component will immediately send it on out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate. It will not complete processing, or sending on any pending data.



=========================
UNCOMPRESSED FRAME FORMAT
=========================

A frame is a dictionary data structure, containing at minimum one of these 
combinations::

    {
      "yuv" : luminance_data
      "pixformat" :  pixelformat        # format of raw video data
      "size" : (width, height)          # in pixels
    }

    {
      "rgb" : rgb_interleaved_data
      "pixformat" :  pixelformat        # format of raw video data
      "size" : (width, height)          # in pixels
    }

CropAndScale only guarantees to fill in the fields above. Any other fields will
be transparently passed through, unmodified.
