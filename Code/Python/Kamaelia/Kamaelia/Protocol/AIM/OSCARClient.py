Kamaelia OSCAR interface
========================
NOTE: These components implement the OSCAR protocol at the lowest level and
require a fairly good knowledge of OSCAR to use them. For a high-level
interface, see AIMHarness.py.

-   The OSCARProtocol component provides a Kamaelia interface for the FLAP level
    of OSCAR protocol. You should not be linking to OSCARProtocol directly, but
    to OSCARClient. 

-   The OSCARClient prefab returns an OSCARProtocol component wired up to a
    TCPClient.

-   SNACExchanger is the base class for all components that deal with the SNAC layer
    of OSCAR protocol. 



Explanation of Terms
------------------------
NOTE: A "byte" in the following documentation refers to an ASCII char, an
unsigned char in C.

OSCAR messages are transmitted in discrete units called FLAPs, which take the
following form::

    -------------------------------------------
    |FLAP-header                              |
    |   message start character (*) -- 1 byte |
    |   channel -- 1 byte                     |
    |   sequence number -- 2 bytes            |
    |   length of following data -- 2 bytes   |
    |-----------------------------------------|
    | ------------                            |
    ||FLAP payload|                           |
    | ------------                            |
    -------------------------------------------

The sequence number is incremented with every FLAP sent. AOL is very strict
about in-order sequence numbers and servers may even disconnect a client for not
sending the right sequence numbers. 

The majority of FLAP payloads (everything except new connection notifications,
really serious errors, shutdown notifications, and keepalives) are units called
SNACs and are transmitted over channel 2.

The structure of a SNAC::

    --------------------------
    |SNAC-header             |
    |  family -- 2 bytes     |
    |  subtype -- 2 bytes    |
    |  request ID -- 2 bytes |
    |  flags -- 4 bytes      |
    |------------------------
    |  --------------        |
    | | SNAC payload |       |
    |  --------------        |
    --------------------------

    
All SNAC payloads must follow a prescribed format unique to the particular type
of SNAC, but all SNAC headers must follow the format described above. Each
different (family, subtype) performs a different function. For example, SNAC
(04, 07) (meaning family 0x04, subtype 0x07) carries AIM messages from the server
to the client, SNAC (01, 11) reports client idle times to the server, and
(04, 06) carries a message from one user to another. 

Yet another type of OSCAR datatype is a type-length-value (TLV) unit.

The structure of a TLV::

    ------------------------------------------
    |TLV-header                              |
    |   type -- 2 bytes                      |
    |   length of following data -- 2 bytes  |
    |----------------------------------------|
    |  ---------                             |
    | |TLV data |                            |
    |  ---------                             |
    -----------------------------------------

TLVs may appear inside SNACs or just inside FLAPs. 



How does it work?
-----------------
OSCARProtocol receives messages on its "talk" inbox in (channel, flap body)
format and retransmits them to "outbox" as true FLAPs. It receives FLAPs on its
"inbox" inbox and retransmits them to its "heard" outbox in the format
(channel, flap body). It also keeps track of sequence numbers.

OSCARClient returns a Graphline with an OSCARProtocol component's inbox/outbox
connected to a TCPClient's outbox/inbox. The Graphline's inbox and outbox are l
inked to the OSCARProtocol component's "talk" and "heard" boxes, respectively.
Send (channel, flap body) tuples to its inbox and receive (channel, flap body)
tuples from the outbox.

SNACExchanger provides specialized methods for dealing with SNACs. You must
subclass it, as it does not have a main method. 



Example Usage
-------------
To get an MD5 key from the authorization server during login::

    class LoginHandler(SNACExchanger):
        def main(self):
            self.send((CHANNEL_NEWCONNECTION,
                       struct.pack('!i', 1)))
            while not self.dataReady():
                yield 1
            reply = self.recv() # server ack of new connection
            zero = struct.pack('!H', 0)
            request = TLV(0x01, "kamaelia1") + TLV(0x4b, zero) + TLV(0x5a, zero)
            self.sendSnac(0x17, 0x06, request)
            for reply in self.waitSnac(0x17, 0x07): yield 1
            md5key = reply[2:]
            print ("%02x " * len(md5key)) % unpackSingles(md5key)

    Graphline(osc = OSCARClient('login.oscar.aol.com', 5190),
              login = LoginHandler(),
              linkages = {("login", "outbox") : ("osc", "inbox"),
                          ("osc", "outbox") : ("login", "inbox"),
                          }
              ).run()
