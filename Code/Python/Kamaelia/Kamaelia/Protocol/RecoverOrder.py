Recover Order of Sequence Numbered Items
========================================

Recovers the order of data tagged with sequence numbers. Designed to cope with
sequence numbers that have to eventually wrap.

Send (seqnum, data) tuples to the "inbox" inbox and they will be sent out of the
"outbox" outbox ordered by ascending sequence number.



Example Usage
-------------

Recovering the order of RTP packets received over multicast::
    
    Pipeline( Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1600, "224.168.2.9", 0),
              SimpleDetupler(1),              # discard the source address
              RTPDeframer(),
              RecoverOrder(bufsize=64, modulo=65536),
              SimpleDetupler(1),              # discard sequence numbers
            ).activate()
    



Behaviour
---------

At initialisation, specify the size of buffer and the modulo (wrapping point)
for sequence numbers.

Send (seqnum, data) tuples to the "inbox" inbox and they will be buffered. Once
the buffer is full, for every item sent to the "inbox" inbox, one will be
emitted from the "outbox" outbox. The ones that are emitted will have been 
reordered by their sequence number.

You must ensure you choose a sufficiently large buffer size for the expected
amount of reordering required. If an item arrives too late, it RecoverOrder
will not be able to place it in its correct position in the sequence. It will
still be emitted, but out of order.

This component does not terminate. It ignores any messages sent to its "control"
inbox.


Implementation details
----------------------

The items are held in an internal buffer. The buffer is always in order - with
the earliest sequence number at the front. Once the buffer is full, items are
taken out from the front - thereby ensuring any delayed out-of-order items are
given every possible chance to make it.

Since sequence numbers eventually wrap, a given sequence number could equally
represent a data item that is very late, or very early.

This decision is made about a threshold - which is chosen to be the point in
the sequence number line roughly furthest from the sequence numbers of the 
items in the buffer. This point is the sequence number of the middle item in
the buffer, plus modulo/2::

       Data in the buffer
       .-------^--------.
       '                '
 |=====XX=X==XXXXXX=XX==X==================================================|
 |             ^                                    ^                      |
 0             |                                    |                    modulo
            midpoint                             midpoint
               |                                + modulo/2
 |<---LATE---->|<--------------EARLY--------------->|<------------LATE---->|
       A       |                 B                  |              C
                                              (aka. threshold)

Items with a sequence number after this threshold point are deemed to be late
(rather than ridiculously early). An item arriving with sequence number B
(marked above) has arrived early, and so should be appended to the end of the
data items in the buffer. Conversely, items arriving with sequence numbers A
or C (also marked above) must be late, so will be inserted at the front of the
buffer.

This is implemented by adding modulo to all sequence numbers below the threshold
when performing comparisons to determine where to insert the new sequence
number into the buffer (the insertion point is found by doing a binary search).
You can think of this as moving ranges A and B after range C.
