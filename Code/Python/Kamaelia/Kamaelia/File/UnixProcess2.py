# yet another attempt at a proper UnixProcess2 able to cope with buffer limiting
# both on input to the subprocess and on output to the destination inbox

"""\
===================================================
Unix sub processes with communication through pipes
===================================================

UnixProcess2 allows you to start a separate process and send data to it and
receive data from it using the standard input/output/error pipes and optional
additional named pipes.

This component works on \*nix platforms only. It is almost certainly not Windows
compatible. Tested only under Linux.



How is this different to UnixProcess?
-------------------------------------

UnixProcess2 differs from UnixProcess in the following ways:

* UnixProcess2 does not drop data if there is a backlog.

* UnixProcess2 allows you to set up extra named input and output pipes.

* UnixProcess2 supports sending data to size limited inboxes. The subprocess
  will be blocked if its output is going into an inbox that is full. This
  enables you to use size limited inboxes to regulate the subprocess.

* UnixProcess2 does not take data from its inboxes until it is able to deliver
  it to the subprocess. If the inboxes are set to be size limiting, this can
  therefore be used to limit the rate of execution of upstream components.



Example Usage
-------------

Using the 'wc' word count GNU util to count the number of lines in some data::
    
    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader(filename, ... ),
              UnixProcess2("wc -l"),
              ConsoleEchoer(),
            ).run()

Feeding separate audio and video streams to ffmpeg, and taking the encoded
output::
    
    Graphline(
        ENCODER = UnixProcess2( "ffmpeg -i audpipe -i vidpipe -",
                               inpipes = { "audpipe":"audio",
                                           "vidpipe":"video",
                                         },
                               boxsizes = { "audio":2, "video":2 }
                             ),
        VIDSOURCE = MaxSpeedFileReader(...),
        AUDSOURCE = MaxSpeFileReader(...),
        SINK = SimpleFileWriter("encodedvideo"),
        linkages = {
            ("VIDSOURCE","outbox") : ("ENCODER","video"),
            ("AUDSOURCE","outbox") : ("ENCODER","audio"),
            ("ENCODER","outbox") : ("SINK", "inbox"),
            }
        ).run()
        


Behaviour
---------

At initialisation, specify:
    
  * the command to invoke the sub process
  * the size limit for internal buffers
  * additional named input and output pipes
  * box size limits for any input pipe's inbox, including "inbox" for STDIN

Named input pipes must all use different inbox names. They must not use "inbox"
or "control". Named output pipes may use any outbox name they wish. More than
one named ouput pipe can use the same outbox, including "outbox".

The pipe files needed for named pipes are created automatically at activation
and are deleted at termination.

Activate UnixProcess2 and the sub process will be started. Use the inboxes and
outboxes of UnixProcess2 to communicate with the sub process. For example::
    
    UnixProcess2( "ffmpeg -i /tmp/inpipe -f wav /tmp/outpipe",
                 inpipes  = { "/tmp/inpipe" :"in"  },
                 outpipes = { "/tmp/outpipe":"out" },
               )
            ________________________________________________
           |                UnixProcess2                     |
           |             _______________________            |
           |            |   "ffmpeg -i ..."     |           |
    ---> "inbox" ---> STDIN                  STDOUT ---> "outbox" --->
           |            |                    STDERR ---> "error"  --->
           |            |                       |           |
    ---> "in"    ---> "/tmp/inpipe"  "/tmp/outpipe" ---> "out"    --->
           |            |_______________________|           |
           |________________________________________________|

Send binary string data to the "inbox" inbox and it will be sent to STDIN of
the proces.

Binary string data from STDOUT and STDERR is sent out of the "outbox" and
"error" outboxes respectively.

To send to a named pipe, send binary string data to the respective inbox you
specified.

Data written by the sub process to a named output pipe will be sent out of the
respective outbox.

The specified buffering size sets a maximum limit on the amount of data that
can be buffered on the inputs and outputs to and from the sub process. It also
determines the chunk size in which data coming from the sub process will emerge.
Note therefore that data may languish in an output buffer indefinitely until
the process terminates. Do not assume that data coming from a sub process will
emerge the moment it is generated.

UnixProcess2 will leave data in its inboxes until it is able to send it to the
required pipe. If a destination box is full (noSpaceInBox exception) then
UnixProces will wait and retry until it succeeds in sending the data.

If the sub process closes its pipes (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR) then UnixProcess2
will close its named input and output pipes too, and will send a
producerFinished message out of its "signal" outbox then immediately terminate.

If a producerFinished message is received on the "control" inbox, UnixProcess2
will finish passing any pending data waiting in inboxes into the sub process and
will finish passing on any pending data waiting to come from the sub process
onto destination outboxes. Once this is complete, UnixProcess2 will close all
pipes and send a producerFinished message out of its "signal" outbox and
immediately terminate.

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the "control" inbox,
UnixProcess2 will close all pipes as soon as possible and send the message on
out of its "signal" outbox and immediately terminate.



How does it work?
-----------------

The UnixProcess2 component itself is primarily just the initiator of the sub
process and a container for other child components that handle the actual I/O
with pipes. It uses _ToFileHandle and _FromFileHandle components for each input
and output pipe respectively.

For each specified named pipe, the specified pipe file is created if required
(using mkfifo).

The shutdown signalling boxes of all child components are daisy chained.
Shutdown messages sent to the "control" inbox of UnixProcess2 are routed to the
"control" inbox of the component handling STDIN. The shutdown message is then
propagated to named output pipes and then named input pipes.

If STDOUT close it causes STDERR to close. If STDERR closes then the shutdown
message is propagated to STDIN and then onto named pipes as described above.

When the process exits, it is assumed the STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR will close by
themselves in due course. However an explicit shutdown message is sent to the
named pipes.



XXX Fix Me
----------

If UnixProcess2 is terminated by receiving shutdown messages, it doesn't
currently explicitly terminate the sub process.
