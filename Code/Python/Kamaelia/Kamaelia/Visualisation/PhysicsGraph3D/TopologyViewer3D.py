Generic 3D Topology Viewer
===========================

A 3D version of TopologyViewer plus hierarchy topology support, pygame based 
display of graph topologies. Rendering and physics laws can be customised 
for specific applications.



Example Usage
-------------
A simple console driven topology viewer::

    Pipeline( ConsoleReader(),
              lines_to_tokenlists(),
              TopologyViewer3D(),
            ).run()

Then at runtime try typing these commands to change the topology in real time::

    >>> DEL ALL
    >>> ADD NODE 1 "1st node" (0,0,-10) teapot
    >>> ADD NODE 2 "2nd node" randompos sphere
    >>> ADD NODE 3 "3rd node" randompos -
    >>> ADD NODE 1:1 "1st child node of the 1st node" " ( 0 , 0 , -10 ) " -
    >>> ADD NODE 1:2 "2nd child node of the 1st node" randompos -
    >>> ADD LINK 1 2
    >>> ADD LINK 3 2
    >>> DEL LINK 1 2
    >>> ADD LINK 1:1 1:2
    >>> DEL NODE 1



User Interface
--------------

TopologyViewer3D manifests as a pygame OpenGL display surface. As it is sent
topology information, nodes and links between them will appear.

You can click a node with the mouse to select it. Depending on the application,
this may display additional data or, if integrated into another app, have some
other effect.

Click and drag with the left mouse button to move nodes around. Note that a
simple physics model or repulsion and attraction forces is always active. This
causes nodes to move around to help make it visually clearer, however you may
still need to drag nodes about to tidy it up.

For hierarchy topology, double-click a particle (or select one then press return key)
to show its child topology; right-click (or press backspace key) to show last level's 
topology.



Operations supported:

    * esc --- quit
    
    * a --- viewer position moves left
    * d --- viewer position moves right
    * w --- viewer position moves up
    * s --- viewer position moves down
    * pgup --- viewer position moves forward (zoom in)
    * pgdn --- viewer position moves backward (zoom out)
    
    * left --- rotate selected particles to left around y axis  (all particles if none of them is selected)
    * right --- rotate selected particles to right around y axis  (all particles if none of them is selected)
    * up --- rotate selected  particles to up around x axis  (all particles if none of them is selected)
    * down --- rotate selected particles to down around x axis  (all particles if none of them is selected)
    * < --- rotate selected particles anticlock-wise around z axis  (all particles if none of them is selected)
    * > --- rotate selected particles clock-wise around z axis  (all particles if none of them is selected)
    * return --- show next level's topology of the selected particle when only one particle is selected
    * backspace --- show last level's topology
    
    * Mouse click --- click particle to select one, click empty area to deselect all
    * Mouse drag --- move particles
    * Mouse double-click --- show next level's topology of the particle clicked
    * Mouse right-click --- show last level's topology
    
    * shift --- multi Select Mode; shift+click for multiple selection/ deselection
    * ctrl ---  rotation Mode; when ctrl is pressed, mouse motion will rotate the selected particle 
                (all particles if none of them is selected)



How does it work?
-----------------

TopologyViewer3D is a Kamaeila component which renders Topology on a pygame OpenGL display surface.

A 3D topology (graph) of nodes and links between them is rendered to the surface.

You can specify an initial topology by providing a list of instantiated
particles and another list of pairs of those particles to show how they are 
linked.

TopologyViewer3D responds to commands arriving at its "inbox" inbox
instructing it on how to change the topology. A command is a list/tuple.

Commands recognised are:

    [ "ADD", "NODE", <id>, <name>, <posSpec>, <particle type> ]
        Add a node, using:
          
        - id            -- a unique ID used to refer to the particle in other topology commands. Cannot be None.
                           For hierarchy topology, the id is joined by its parent id with ":" to represent the 
                           hierarchy structure.
                           E.g., suppose the topology has 3 levels. The id of a particle in the 1st level is 1Node;
                           it has a child particle whose id is 2Node; 2Node also has a child particle whose id is 3Node;
                           then their ids are represented as
                           1Node
                           1Node:2Node
                           1Node:2Node:3Node 
        - name          -- string name label for the particle
        - posSpec       -- string describing initial (x,y,z) (see _generateXY); spaces are allowed
                           within the tuple, but quotation is needed in this case.
                           E.g., " ( 0 , 0 , -10 ) "
        - particleType  -- particle type (default provided is "-", unless custom types are provided - see below)
                           currently supported: "-" same as cuboid, cuboid, sphere and teapot
                           Note: it would be much slower than cuboid if either sphere or teapot is used.
      
    [ "DEL", "NODE", <id> ]
        Remove a node (also removes all links to and from it)
        
    [ "ADD", "LINK", <id from>, <id to> ]
        Add a link, directional from fromID to toID
           
    [ "DEL", "LINK", <id from>, <id to> ]
        Remove a link, directional from fromID to toID
               
    [ "DEL", "ALL" ]
        Clears all nodes and links

    [ "GET", "ALL" ]
        Outputs the current topology as a list of commands, just like
        those used to build it. The list begins with a 'DEL ALL'.

    [ "UPDATE_NAME", "NODE", <id>, <new name> ]
        If the node does not already exist, this does NOT cause it to be created.

    [ "GET_NAME", "NODE", <id> ]
        Returns UPDATE_NAME NODE message for the specified node

Commands are processed immediately, in the order in which they arrive. You
therefore cannot refer to a node or linkage that has not yet been created, or
that has already been destroyed.

If a stream of commands arrives in quick succession, rendering and physics will
be temporarily stopped, so commands can be processed more quickly. This is
necessary because when there is a large number of particles, physics and
rendering starts to take a long time, and will therefore bottleneck the
handling of commands.

However, there is a 1 second timeout, so at least one update of the visual
output is guaranteed per second.

TopologyViewer sends any output to its "outbox" outbox in the same
list/tuple format as used for commands sent to its "inbox" inbox. The following
may be output:

    [ "SELECT", "NODE", <id> ]
        Notification that a given node has been selected.
    
    [ "SELECT", "NODE", None ]
       Notificaion that *no node* is now selected. 
        
    [ "TOPOLOGY", <topology command list> ]
        List of commands needed to build the topology, as it currently stands.
        The list will start with a ("DEL","ALL") command.
        This is sent in response to receiving a ("GET","ALL") command.

Error and tip information is printed out directly when applied.

For hierarchy topology, the id of particles should be joined by its parent id with ":" 
to represent the hierarchy structure. See "ADD NODE" command above for more information.



Termination
-----------

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on this component's "control"
inbox, it will pass it on out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate.

NOTE: Termination is currently rather cludgy - it raises an exception which
will cause the rest of a kamaelia system to halt. Do not rely on this behaviour
as it will be changed to provide cleaner termination at some point.



Customising the 3D topology viewer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can customise:

- the 'types' of particles (nodes)
- visual appearance of particles (nodes) and the links between them;
- the physics laws used to assist with layout

Use the particleTypes argument of the initialiser to specify classes that
should be instantiated to render each type of particle (nodes). particleTypes 
should be a dictionary mapping names for particle types to the respective 
classes, for example::

    { "major" : BigParticle,  "minor"  : SmallParticle  }

See below for information on how to write your own particle classes.

Layout of the nodes on the surface is assisted by a physics model, provided
by an instance of the Kamaelia.Support.Particles.ParticleSystem class. Freeze them
if you want to make some particles not subject to the law (particle.freeze()).

Customise the laws used for each particle type by providing a
Kamaelia.Phyics.Simple.MultipleLaws object at initialisation.



Writing your own particle class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

should inherit from Kamaelia.PhysicsGraph3D.Particles3D.Particle3D 
and implement the following method (for rendering purposes):

    draw()
        draw OpenGL particles and links in this method.
