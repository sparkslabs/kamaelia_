Generic Topology Viewer
=======================

Pygame based display of graph topologies. A simple physics model assists with
visual layout. Rendering and physics laws can be customised for specific
applications.



Example Usage
-------------
A simple console driven topology viewer::

    Pipeline( ConsoleReader(),
              lines_to_tokenlists(),
              TopologyViewer(),
            ).run()

Then at runtime try typing these commands to change the topology in real time::

    >>> DEL ALL
    >>> ADD NODE 1 "1st node" randompos -
    >>> ADD NODE 2 "2nd node" randompos -
    >>> ADD NODE 3 "3rd node" randompos -
    >>> ADD LINK 1 2
    >>> ADD LINK 3 2
    >>> DEL LINK 1 2
    >>> DEL NODE 1

    
   

User Interface
--------------

TopologyViewer manifests as a pygame display surface. As it is sent
topology information nodes and links between them will appear.

You can click a node with the mouse to select it. Depending on the application,
this may display additional data or, if integrated into another app,  have some
other effect.

Click and drag with the left mouse button to move nodes around. Note that a
simple physics model or repulsion and attraction forces is always active. This
causes nodes to move around to help make it visually clearer, however you may
still need to drag nodes about to tidy it up.

The surface on which the nodes appear is notionally infinite. Scroll around
using the arrow keys.

Press the 'f' key to toggle between windowed and fullscreen modes.




How does it work?
-----------------

TopologyViewer is a specialisation of the Kamaeila.UI.MH.PyGameApp
component. See documentation for that component to understand how it obtains
and handles events for a pygame display surface.

A topology (graph) of nodes and links between them is rendered to the surface.

You can specify an initial topology by providing a list of instantiated
particles and another list of pairs of those particles to show how they are 
linked.

TopologyViewer reponds to commands arriving at its "inbox" inbox
instructing it on how to change the topology. A command is a list/tuple.

Commands recognised are:

    [ "ADD", "NODE", <id>, <name>, <posSpec>, <particle type> ]
        Add a node, using:
          
        - id            -- a unique ID used to refer to the particle in other topology commands. Cannot be None.
        - name          -- string name label for the particle
        - posSpec       -- string describing initial x,y (see _generateXY)
        - particleType  -- particle type (default provided is "-", unless custom types are provided - see below)
      
    [ "DEL", "NODE", <id> ]
        Remove a node (also removes all links to and from it)
        
    [ "ADD", "LINK", <id from>, <id to> ]
        Add a link, directional from fromID to toID
           
    [ "DEL", "LINK", <id from>, <id to> ]
        Remove a link, directional from fromID to toID
               
    [ "DEL", "ALL" ]
        Clears all nodes and links

    [ "GET", "ALL" ]
        Outputs the current topology as a list of commands, just like
        those used to build it. The list begins with a 'DEL ALL'.

    [ "UPDATE_NAME", "NODE", <id>, <new name> ]
        If the node does not already exist, this does NOT cause it
        to be created.

    [ "GET_NAME", "NODE", <id> ]
        Returns UPDATE_NAME NODE message for the specified node
        
    [ "FREEZE", "ALL" ]
        Freezes all particles in the system, essentially halting the
        simulation
        
    [ "UNFREEZE", "ALL" ]
        Unfreezes all particles in the system, essentially restarting
        the simulation
    

Commands are processed immediately, in the order in which they arrive. You
therefore cannot refer to a node or linkage that has not yet been created, or
that has already been destroyed.

If a stream of commands arrives in quick succession, rendering and physics will
be temporarily stopped, so commands can be processed more quickly. This is
necessary because when there is a large number of particles, physics and
rendering starts to take a long time, and will therefore bottleneck the
handling of commands.

However, there is a 1 second timeout, so at least one update of the visual
output is guaranteed per second.

TopologyViewer sends any output to its "outbox" outbox in the same
list/tuple format as used for commands sent to its "inbox" inbox. The following
may be output:

    [ "SELECT", "NODE", <id> ]
        Notification that a given node has been selected.
    
    [ "SELECT", "NODE", None ]
       Notificaion that *no node* is now selected. 
        
    [ "ERROR", <error string> ]
        Notification of errors - eg. unrecognised commands arriving at the
        "inbox" inbox
        
    [ "TOPOLOGY", <topology command list> ]
        List of commands needed to build the topology, as it currently stands.
        The list will start with a ("DEL","ALL") command.
        This is sent in response to receiving a ("GET","ALL") command.


Termination
-----------

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on this component's "control"
inbox this it will pass it on out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate.

Historical note for short term: this has changed as of May 2008. In the past,
this component would also shutdown when it recieved a producerFinished message.
This has transpired to be a mistake for a number of different systems, hence
the change to only shutting down when it recieves a  shutdownMicroprocess
message.


NOTE: Termination is currently rather cludgy - it raises an exception which
will cause the rest of a kamaelia system to halt. Do not rely on this behaviour
as it will be changed to provide cleaner termination at some point.


Customising the topology viewer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can customise:

- the 'types' of particles (nodes)
- visual appearance of particles (nodes) and the links between them;
- the physics laws used to assist with layout
- extra visual furniture to be rendered

For example, see Kamaelia.Visualisation.Axon.AxonVisualiserServer. This
component uses two types of particle - to represent components and
inboxes/outboxes. Each has a different visual appearance, and the laws acting
between them differ depending on which particle types are involved in the
interaction.

Use the particleTypes argument of the initialiser to specify classes that
should be instantiated to render each type of particle (nodes). particleTypes 
should be a dictionary mapping names for particle types to the respective 
classes, for example::

    { "major" : BigParticle,  "minor"  : SmallParticle  }

See below for information on how to write your own particle classes.

Layout of the nodes on the surface is assisted by a physics model, provided
by an instance of the Kamaelia.Support.Particles.ParticleSystem class.

Customise the laws used for each particle type by providing a
Kamaelia.Phyics.Simple.MultipleLaws object at initialisation.


Writing your own particle class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

should inherit from Kamaelia.Support.Particles.Particle and implement the following
methods (for rendering purposes):

    setOffset( (left,top) )
        Notification that the surface has been scrolled by the user. Particles 
        should adjust the coordinates at which they render. For example, a
        particle at (x, y) should be rendered at (x-left, y-top). You can
        assume, until setOffset(...) is called, that (left,top) is (0,0).
    
    select()
        Called to inform the particle that it is selected (has been clicked on)
    
    deselect()
        Called to inform the particle that is has been deselected.
    
    render(surface) -> generator
        Called to get a generator for multi-pass rendering of the particle (see
        below)
    
The coordinates of the particle are updated automatically both due to mouse 
dragging and due to the physics model. See Kamaelia.Support.Particles.Particle for
more information.

The render(...) method should return a generator that will render the particle
itself and its links/bonds to other particles.

Rendering by the TopologyViewer is multi-pass. This is done so that
irrespective of the order in which particles are chosen to be rendered,
things that need to be rendered before (underneath) other things can be done
consistently.

The generator should yield the number of the rendering pass it wishes to be
next called on. Each time it is subsequently called, it should perform the
rendering required for that pass. It then yields the number of the next required
pass or completes if there is no more rendering required. Passes go in
ascending numerical order.

For example, Kamaelia.Visualisation.PhysicsGraph.RenderingParticle renders in
two passes::

    def render(self, surface):
        yield 1
        # render lines for bonds *from* this particle *to* others
        yield 2
        # render a blob and the name label for the particle

...in this case it ensures that the blobs for the particles always appear
on top of the lines representing the bonds between them.

Note that rendering passes must be coded in ascending order, but the numbering
can otherwise be arbitrary: The first pass can be any value you like; subsequent
passes can also be any value, provided it is higher.

When writing rendering code for particle(s), make sure they all agree on who
should render what. It is inefficient if all bonds are being rendered twice.
For example, RenderingParticle only renders links *from* that particle *to*
another, but not in another direction.
