Simple generic particle for Topology visualisation
==================================================

This is an implementation of a simple rendering particle for topology
visualisation.



Example Usage
-------------

A topology viewer where particles of type "-" are rendered by RenderingParticle
instances::

    TopologyViewer( particleTypes = {"-":RenderingParticle},
                    laws = Kamaelia.Support.Particles.SimpleLaws(),
                  ).run()

SimpleLaws are used that apply the same simple physics laws for all particle
types.



How does it work?
-----------------

This object subclasses Kamaelia.Support.Particles.Particle and adds methods to
support rendering.

At initialisation, provide a unique ID, a starting (x,y) position tuple, and
a name. The name is displayed as a label ontop of the particle.

If the particle becomes selected it changes its visual appearance to reflect
this.

It also renders bonds *from* this particle *to* another. They are rendered as
simple lines.

Rendering is performed by a generator, returned when the render() method is
called. Its behaviour is that needed for the framework for multi-pass rendering
that is used by TopologyViewer.

The generator yields the number of the rendering pass it wishes to be next on
next. Each time it is subsequently called, it performs the rendering required
for that pass. It then yields the number of the next required pass or completes
if there is no more rendering required.

An setOffset() method is also implemented to allow the particles coordinates
to be offset. This therefore makes it possible to scroll the particles around
the display surface.

See TopologyViewer for more details.
