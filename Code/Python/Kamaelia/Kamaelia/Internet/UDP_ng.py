Simple UDP components
=====================

These components provide simple support for sending and receiving UDP packets.

NOTE: This set of components really an evolution of those in UDP.py, and is
likely to replace those in future.

Example Usage
-------------

Send console input to port 1500 of myserver.com and receive packets locally on
port 1501 displaying their contents (and where they came from) on the console::
    
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
    from Kamaelia.Util.Console import ConsoleEchoer
    from Kamaelia.Util.Console import ConsoleReader
    from Kamaelia.Internet.UDP import SimplePeer
    
    Pipeline( ConsoleReader(),
              SimplePeer("127.0.0.1", 1501, "myserver.com", 1500),
              ConsoleEchoer(),
            ).run()


Sends data from a data source as UDP packets, changing between 3 different
destinations, once per second::

    class DestinationSelector(component):
        def main(self):
            while 1:
                for dest in [ ("server1.com",1500),
                              ("server2.com",1500),
                              ("server3.com",1500), ]:
                    self.send(dest,"outbox")
                next=time.time()+1.0
                while time.time() < next:
                    yield 1
                    
    Graphline( \
        SOURCE = MyDataSource(),
        SELECT = DestinationSelector(),
        UDP    = TargettedPeer(),
        linkages = {
            ("SOURCE", "outbox") : ("UDP", "inbox"),
            ("SELECT", "outbox") : ("UDP", "target"),
        }
    ).run()

Send UDP packets containing "hello" to several different servers, all on port
1500::
    
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
    from Kamaelia.Util.DataSource import DataSource
    from Kamaelia.Internet.UDP import PostboxPeer
    
    Pipeline(
        DataSource( [ ("myserver1.com",1500,"hello"),
                      ("myserver2.com",1500,"hello"),
                      ("myserver3.com",1500,"hello"),
                    ]
                    ),
        PostboxPeer(),
    ).run()



Behaviour
---------

When any of these components receive a UDP packet on the local address and port
they are bound to; they send out a tuple (data,(host,port)) out of their
"outbox" outboxes. 'data' is a string containing the payload of the packet.
(host,port) is the address of the sender/originator of the packet.

SimplePeer is the simplest to use. Any data sent to its "inbox" inbox is sent
as a UDP packet to the destination (receiver) specified at initialisation.

UDPSender and UDPReceiver duplicate the sending and receiving functionality of
SimplePeer in seperate components.

TargettedPeer behaves identically to SimplePeer; however the destination
(receiver) it sends UDP packets to can be changed by sending a new (host,port)
tuple to its "target" inbox.

PostboxPeer does not have a fixed destination (receiver) to which it sends UDP
packets. Send (host,port,data) tuples to its "inbox" inbox to arrange for a UDP
packet containing the specified data to be sent to the specified (host,port).

All of the components shutdown upon receiving a ShutdownMicroprocess message
on their "control" inbox.  UDPSender also shuts down upon receiving a
ProducerFinished message on its "control" inbox.  In this case before it shuts
down it sends any data in its send queue, and any data waiting on its inbox.

Implementation Details
----------------------

All of the UDP components are all derived from the base class BasicPeer.
BasicPeer provides some basic code for sending and receiving from a socket.

Although technically BasicPeer is a component, it is not a usable one as it
does not implement a main() method.
