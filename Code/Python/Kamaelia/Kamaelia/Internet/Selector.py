# FIXME: This doesn't really provide a means for people to ask for
#        the service and release the service. The problem this
#        causes is that the selector has no simple means of shutting
#        down when no one is using it.

NOTIFICATION OF SOCKET AND FILE EVENTS
======================================

The Selector component listens for events on sockets and sends out notifications.
It is effectively a wrapper around the unix 'select' statement. Components
request that the Selector component notify them when a supplied socket or file
object is ready.

The selectorComponent is a service that registers with the Coordinating
Assistant Tracker (CAT).

NOTE: The behaviour and API of this component changed in Kamaelia 0.4 and is
likely to change again in the near future.



Example Usage
-------------

See the source code for TCPClient for an example of how the Selector component
can be used.



How does it work?
-----------------

Selector is a service. Obtain it by calling the static method 
Selector.getSelectorService(...). Any existing instance will be returned,
otherwise a new one is automatically created.

This component ignores anything sent to its "inbox" and "control" inboxes. This
component does not terminate.

Register socket or file objects with the selector, to receive a one-shot
notification when that file descriptor is ready. The file descriptor can be
a python file object or socket object. The notification is one-shot - meaning
you must resubmit your request every time you wish to receive a notification.

Ensure you deregister the file object when closing the file/socket. You may do
this even if you have already received the notification. The Selector component
will be unable to handle notifications for any other descriptors if it still has
a registered descriptor that has closed.

Register for a notification by sending an one of the following messages to the
"notify" inbox, as returned by Selector.getSelectorService():

* Kamaelia.KamaeliaIpc.newReader(caller, (component,inboxname), descriptor)
* Kamaelia.KamaeliaIpc.newWriter(caller, (component,inboxname), descriptor)
* Kamaelia.KamaeliaIpc.newExceptional(caller, (component,inboxname), descriptor)

Choose which as appropriate:

* a newReader() request will notify when there is data ready to be read on
  the descriptor
* a newWriter() request will notify when writing to the descriptor will not
  block.
* a newExceptional() request will notify when an exceptional event occurs on
  the specified descriptor.
     
Selector will notify the taret component by sending the file/socket descriptor
object to the target inbox the component provided. It then automatically
deregisters the descriptor, unlinking from the target component's inbox.

For a given descriptor for a given type of event (read/write/exceptional) only
one notification will be sent when the event occurs. If multiple notification
requests have been received, only the first is listened to; all others are
ignored.

Of course, once the notification as happened, or someone has requested that
descriptor be deregistered, then someone can register for it once again.

Deregister by sending on of the following messages to the "notify" inbox of
Selector:

* Kamaelia.KamaeliaIpc.removeReader(caller, descriptor)
* Kamaelia.KamaeliaIpc.removeWriter(caller, descriptor)
* Kamaelia.KamaeliaIpc.removeExceptional(caller, descriptor)

It is advisable to send a deregister message when the corresponding file
descriptor closes, in case you registered for a notification, but it has not
occurred.
