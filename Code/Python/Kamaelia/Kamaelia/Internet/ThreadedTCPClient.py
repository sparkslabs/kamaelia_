Simple Threaded TCP Client
==========================

This component is for making a TCP connection to a server. Send to its "inbox"
inbox to send data to the server. Pick up data received from the server on its
"outbox" outbox.

This component runs in its own separate thread so it can block on the socket
connection. This was written because some platforms that don't support
non-blocking calls to read/write data from sockets (eg. Python for
Nokia Series-60).



Example Usage
-------------

Sending the contents of a file to a server at address 1.2.3.4 on port 1000::

    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myfile", rate=100000),
              ThreadedTCPClient("1.2.3.4", 1000),
            ).activate()



How does it work?
-----------------

The component opens a socket connection to the specified server on the specified
port. Data received over the connection appears at the component's "outbox"
outbox as strings. Data can be sent as strings by sending it to the "inbox"
inbox.

The component will shutdown in response to a producerFinished message arriving
on its "control" inbox. The socket will be closed, and a socketShutdown message
will be sent to the "signal" outbox.

All socket errors exceptions are passed on out of the "signal" outbox. This will
always result in the socket being closed (if open) and a socketShutdown message
also being sent to the "signal" outbox (after the exception).

It does not use a ConnectedSocketAdapter, instead handling all socket
communications itself.

The compnent is based on Axon.ThreadedComponent.threadedcomponent

#
# - needs reworking somewhat - bit messy, plus lacks error handling
# - and spits all kinds of crud out of its "signal" outbox
# - shutdown behaviour is different to that of TCPClient
