TCP Socket Server
=================

A building block for creating a TCP based network server. It accepts incoming
connection requests and sets up a component to handle the socket which it then
passes on.

This component does not handle the instantiation of components to handle an
accepted connection request. Another component is needed that responds to this
component and actually does something with the newly established connection.
If you require a more complete implementation that does this, see
Kamaelia.Internet.SingleServer or Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer.



Example Usage
-------------

See Kamaelia.Internet.SingleServer or Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer for examples of how
this component can be used.

The process of using a TCPServer component can be summarised as:
- Create a TCP Server
- Wait for newCSA messages from the TCP Server's "protocolHandlerSignal" outbox
- Send what you like to CSA's, ensure you recieve data from the CSAs
- Send producerFinished to the CSA to shut it down.


How does it work?
-----------------

This component creates a listener socket, bound to the specified port, and
registers itself and the socket with a selectorComponent so it is notified of
incoming connections. The selectorComponent is obtained by calling
selectorComponent.getSelectorService(...) to look it up with the local
Coordinating Assistant Tracker (CAT).

When the it recieves a new connection it performs an accept, and creates
a ConnectedSocketAdapter (CSA) to handle the activity on that connection.

The CSA is passed in a newCSA(self,CSA) message to TCPServer's
"protocolHandlerSignal" outbox.

The CSA is also registered with the selector service by sending it a
newCSA(self,(CSA,sock)) message, to ensure the CSA is notified of incoming data
on its socket.

The client component(s) using the TCPServer should handle the newly created CSA
passed to it in whatever way it sees fit.

If a socketShutdown message is received on the "_feedbackFromCSA" inbox, then a
shutdownCSA(self, CSA) message is sent to TCPServer's "protocolHandlerSignal"
outbox to notify the client component that the connection has closed.

Also, a shutdownCSA(self, (CSA, sock)) message is sent to the selector service
to deregister the CSA from receiving notifications.

This component does not terminate.
