Simple multicast transceiver
============================

A simple component for transmitting and receiving multicast packets.

Remember that multicast is an unreliable connection - packets may be lost,
duplicated or reordered. 



Example Usage
-------------

Send a file to, and receive data from multicast group address 1.2.3.4 port 1000::

    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myfile", rate=100000),
              Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 0, "1.2.3.4", 1000),
            ).activate()

    Pipeline( Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1000, "1.2.3.4", 0)
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()

Or::
    
    Pipeline( RateControlledFileReader("myfile", rate=100000),
              Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1000, "1.2.3.4", 1000),
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()

The data emitted by Multicast_transciever (and displayed by ConsoleEchoer) is of
the form (source_address, data).



More detail
-----------

Data sent to the component's "inbox" inbox is sent to the multicast group.

Data received from the multicast group is emitted as a tuple:
(source_addr, data) where data is a string of the received data.

This component ignores anything received on its "control" inbox. It is not yet
possible to ask it to shut down. It does not terminate.

Multicast groups do not 'shut down', so this component never emits any signals
on its "signal" outbox.



Why a transciever component?
----------------------------
Listens for packets in the given multicast group. Any data received is
sent to the receiver's outbox. The logic here is likely to be not quite
ideal. When complete though, this will be preferable over the sender and
receiver components since it models what multicast really is rather than
what people tend to think it is.
