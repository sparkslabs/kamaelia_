Simple multicast receiver
=========================

A simple component for receiving packets in the specified multicast group.

Remember that multicast is an unreliable connection - packets may be lost,
duplicated or reordered. 



Example Usage
-------------

Receiving multicast packets from group address 1.2.3.4 port 1000 and displaying
them on the console::

    Pipeline( Multicast_receiver("1.2.3.4", 1000),
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()

The data emitted by Multicast_receiver (and displayed by ConsoleEchoer) is of
the form (source_address, data).



More detail
-----------

Data received from the multicast group is emitted as a tuple:
(source_addr, data) where data is a string of the received data.

This component ignores anything received on its "control" inbox. It is not yet
possible to ask it to shut down. It does not terminate.

Multicast groups do not 'shut down', so this component never emits any signals
on its "signal" outbox.
