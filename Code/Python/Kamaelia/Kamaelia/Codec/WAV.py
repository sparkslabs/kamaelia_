Reading and writing simple WAV audio files
==========================================

Read and write WAV file format audio data using the WAVParser and WAVWriter
components, respectively.



Example Usage
-------------

Playing a WAV file, where we don't know the format until we play it::
    
    from Kamaelia.Audio.PyMedia.Output import Output
    from Kamaelia.File.Reading import RateControlledFileReader
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Graphline import Graphline
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Carousel import Carousel
        
    def makeAudioOutput(format_info):
        return Output( sample_rate = format_info['sample_rate'],
                       format      = format_info['sample_format'],
                       channels    = format_info['channels']
                     )
    
    Graphline(
        SRC = RateControlledFileReader("test.wav",readmode="bytes",rate=44100*4),
        WAV = WAVParser(),
        DST = Carousel(makeAudioOutput),
        linkages = {
            ("SRC","outbox") : ("WAV","inbox"),
            ("SRC","signal") : ("WAV","control"),
            ("WAV","outbox") : ("DST","inbox"),
            ("WAV","signal") : ("DST","control"),
            ("WAV","all_meta") : ("DST","next"),
        }
        ).run()
    
Capturing audio and writing it to a WAV file::
        
    from Kamaelia.Audio.PyMedia.Input import Input
    from Kamaelia.File.Writing import SimpleFileWriter
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
        
    Pipeline( Input(sample_rate=44100, channels=2, format="S16_LE"),
              WAVWriter(sample_rate=44100, channels=2, format="S16_LE"),
              SimpleFileWriter("captured_audio.wav"),
            ).run()



WAVParser behaviour
-------------------

Send binary data as strings containing a WAV file to the "inbox" inbox.

As soon as the format of the audio data is determined (from the headers) it is
sent out the "all_meta" outbox as a dictionary, for example::

    { "sample_format" : "S16_LE",
      "channels"      : 2,
      "sample_rate"   : 44100,
    }
    
The individual components are also sent out the "sample_format", "channels" and
"sample_rate" outboxes.

The raw audio data from the incoming WAV data is sent out of the "outbox"
outbox, until the end of the WAV file is reached. If the WAV headers specify an
audio size of zero, then it is assumed to be of indefinite length, otherwise the
value is assumed to be the actual size, and this component will terminate and
send out a producerFinished() message when it thinks it has reached the end.

This component supports sending the raw audio data to a size limited inbox.
If the size limited inbox is full, this component will pause until it is able
to send out the data.

If a producerFinished message is received on the "control" inbox, this component
will complete parsing any data pending in its inbox, and finish sending any
resulting data to its outbox. It will then send the producerFinished message on
out of its "signal" outbox and terminate.

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the "control" inbox, this
component will immediately send it on out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate. It will not complete processing, or sending on any pending data.



WAVWriter behaviour
-------------------

Initialise this component, specifying the format the audio data will be in.

Send raw audio data (in the format you specified!) as binary strings to the
"inbox" inbox, and this component will write it out as WAV file format data out
of the "outbox" outbox.

The WAV format headers will immediately be sent out of the "outbox" outbox as
soon as this component is initialised and activated (ie. before you even start
sending it audio data to write out). The size of the audio data is set to zero
as the component has no way of knowing the duration of the audio.

This component supports sending data out of its outbox to a size limited inbox.
If the size limited inbox is full, this component will pause until it is able
to send out the data.

If a producerFinished message is received on the "control" inbox, this component
will complete parsing any data pending in its inbox, and finish sending any
resulting data to its outbox. It will then send the producerFinished message on
out of its "signal" outbox and terminate.

If a shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the "control" inbox, this
component will immediately send it on out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate. It will not complete processing, or sending on any pending data.



Development history
-------------------

WAVWriter is based on code by Ryn Lothian developed during summer 2006.
