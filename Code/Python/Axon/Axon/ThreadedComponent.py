Thread based components
=======================

A threaded component is like an ordinary component but where the main() method
is an ordinary method that is run inside its own thread. (Normally main() is
a generator that is given slices of execution time by the scheduler).

This is really useful if your code needs to block - eg. wait on a system call,
or if it is better off being able to run on another CPU (though beware python's
limited ability to scale across multiple CPUs).

If you don't need these capabilities, consider making your component an ordinary
Axon.Component.component instead.

* threadedcomponent - like an ordinary Axon.Component.component, but runs in its
  own thread
* threadedadaptivecommscomponent - a threaded version of
  Axon.AdaptiveCommsComponent.AdaptiveCommsComponent



Just like writing an ordinary component
---------------------------------------

This is nearly identical to writing an ordinary Axon.Component.component. For
example this ordinary component::

    class MyComponent(Axon.Component.component):

        Inboxes = { "inbox"   : "Send the FOO objects to here",
                    "control" : "NOT USED",
                  }
        Outboxes = { "outbox" : "Emits BAA objects from here",
                     "signal" : "NOT USED",
                   }

        def main(self):
            while 1:
                if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                    msg = self.recv("inbox")
                    result = ... do something to msg ...
                    self.send(result, "outbox")

                yield 1

Can be trivially written as a threaded component simply by removing the
``yield`` statements, turning main() into a normal method::
    
    class MyComponent(Axon.ThreadedComponent.threadedcomponent):

        Inboxes = { "inbox"   : "Send the FOO objects to here",
                    "control" : "NOT USED",
                  }
        Outboxes = { "outbox" : "Emits BAA objects from here",
                     "signal" : "NOT USED",
                   }

        def main(self):
            while 1:
                if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                    msg = self.recv("inbox")
                    result = ... do something to msg ...
                    self.send(result, "outbox")


What can a threaded component do?
---------------------------------

Exactly the same things any other component can. The following method calls are
all implemented in a thread safe manner and function exactly as you should
expect:

* self.link()
* self.unlink()
* self.dataReady()
* self.anyReady()
* self.recv()
* self.send()

*self.pause()* behaves slightly differently:

* calling self.pause() pauses immediately - not at the next yield statement
  (since there are no yield statements!)
* self.pause() has an extra optional 'timeout' argument to allow you to write
  timer code that can be interrupted, for example, by incoming messages.


In addition, threadedadaptivecommscomponent also supports the extra methods in
Axon.AdaptiveCommsComponent.AdaptiveCommsComponent:
                    
* self.addInbox()
* self.deleteInbox()
* self.addOutbox()
* self.deleteOutbox()
* *etc..*



Inbox and Outbox queues
-----------------------

There is one difference: because the main() method runs in a different thread
it does not actually interact directly with its own inboxes and outboxes.
Internal queues are used to get data between your thread and the component's
actual inboxes and outboxes. This is hidden for the most part - the method calls
you make to receive and send messages are exactly the same.

When initialising a threadedcomponent you may wish to specify the size limit
(queue length) for these queues. There is a size limit so that if your threaded
component is delivering to a size limited inbox, the effects of the inbox
becoming full propagate back to your thread.

In some ways this is a bit like nesting one component within another - where
all the parent component's inboxes and outboxes are forwarded to the child::

            +-----------------------------------------+
            |           threaded component            |
            |                                         |
            |              +----------+               |
            |              |  main()  |               |
          INBOX -------> inbox      outbox -------> OUTBOX
            |    queue     |          |     queue     |
            |              +----------+               |
            +-----------------------------------------+

What does this mean in practice?

* *More messages get buffered*. - Suppose your threaded component has an internal
  queues of size 5 and is delivering messages to an inbox on another component
  with a size limit of 10. From the perspective of your threaded component you
  will actually be able to send 15 messages before you might start to get
  Axon.AxonExceptions.noSpaceInBox exceptions.

* *Threaded components that output lots of messages might see unexpected 'box
  full' exceptions* - Suppose your threaded component has a small internal queue
  size but produces lots of messages very quickly. The rest of the system may
  not be able to pick up those messages quickly enough to put them into the
  destination inbox. So even though the destination might not have a size limit
  you may still get these exceptions.

The secret is to choose a sensible queue size to balance between it being able
to buffer enough messages without generating errors whilst not being so large as
to render a size limited inbox pointless!


Regulating speed
----------------

In addition to being able to pause (with an optional timeout), a threaded
component can also regulate its speed by briefly synchronising with the rest of
the system. Calling the sync() method simply briefly blocks until the rest of
the system can acknowledge.



Stopping a threaded component
-----------------------------

Note that it is *not* safe to forcibly stop a threaded component (by calling
the stop() method before the microprocess in it has terminated). This is because
there is no true support in python for killing a thread.

Calling stop() prematurely will therefore kill the internal microprocess that
handles inbox/outbox traffic on behalf of the thread, resulting in undefined
behaviour.



When the thread terminates...
-----------------------------

threadedcomponent will terminate - as you would expect. However, there are some
subtleties that may need to be considered. These are due to the existence of the
intermediate queues used to communicate between the thread and the actual
inboxes and outboxes (as described above).

* When main() terminates, even if it has just recently checked its inqueues
  (inboxes) there might still be items of data at the inboxes.
  This is because there is a gap between data that arriving at an inbox, and it
  being forwarded into an inqueue going to the thread.

* When main() terminates, threadedcomponent will keep executing until it has
  finished successfully sending any data in outqueues, out of the respective
  "outboxes". This means that anything main() thinks it has sent is guaranteed
  to be sent. But if the destination is a size limited inbox that has become
  full (and that never gets emptied), then threadedcomponent will indefinitely
  stall because it cannot finish sending.



How is threaded component implemented?
--------------------------------------

threadedcomponet subclasses Axon.Components.component. It overrides the
activate() method, to force activation to use a method called _localmain()
instead of the usual main(). The code that someone writes for their main()
method is instead run in a separate thread.

The code running in main() does not directly access inboxes our outboxes and
doesn't actually create or destroy linkages itself. _localmain() can be thought
of as a kind of proxy for the thread - acting on its behalf within the main
scheduler run thread.

main() is wrapped by _threadmain() which tries to trap any unhandled exceptions
generated in the thread and pass them back to _localmain() to be rethrown.

Internal state:

* **_threadrunning** - flag, cleared by the thread when it terminates
* **queuelengths** - size to be used for internal queues between thread and
  inboxes and outboxes
* **_threadmainmethod** - the main method to be run as a thread
* **_thethread** - the thread object itself

Internal to _localmain():

* **running** - flag tracking if the thread is still runnning
* **stuffWaiting** - flag tracking if there is are things that need to be done
  (if there is stuff waiting then _localmain() should not pause or terminate
  until it finishes)

Communication between the thread and _localmain():
                    
* **inqueues** - dictionary of thread safe queues for getting data from inboxes to the thread
* **outqueues** - dictionary of thread safe queues for getting data from the thread to outboxes
* **threadtoaxonqueue** - thread safe queue for making requests to _localmain()
* **axontothreadqueue** - thread safe queue for replies from _localmain()
* **threadWakeUp** - thread safe event flag for waking up the thread if sleeping
* **_threadId** - unique id that is given to the thread as its 'name'
* **_localThreadId** - the thread id (name) of the thread _localmain() and the scheduler run in


The relationship between _localmain() and the main() method (running in a
separate thread) looks like this::

    |           +--------------------------------------------+            |
    |                                                                     |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

When a message arrives at an inbox, _localmain() collects it and places it into
the thread safe queue self.inqueues[boxname] from which the thread can collect
it. self.dataReady() and self.recv() are both overridden so they access the
queues instead of the normal inboxes.

Similarly, when the thread wants to send to an outbox; self.send() is overridden
so that it is actually sent to a thread safe queue self.outqueues[boxname] from
which _localmain() collects it and sends it on.

Because all queues have a size limit (specified in at initialisation of the
threaded component) this enables the effects of size limited inboxes to
propagate up to the separate thread, via the queue. The implementation of
self.send() is designed to mimic the behaviour

For other methods such as link(), unlink() and (in the case of
threadedadaptivecommscomponent) addInbox(), deleteInbox(), addOutbox() and
deleteOutbox(), the _localmain() microprocess also acts on the thread's behalf.
The request to do something is sent to _localmain() through the thread safe
queue self.threadtoaxonqueue. When the operation is complete, an acknowledgement
is sent back via another queue self.axontothreadqueue::

        _localmain()                         main() [thread]
             |                                 |
             |       please call 'link()'      |
             | ------------------------------> |
             |                                 |
             |                         self.link() called
             |                                 |
             |      return value from call     |
             | <------------------------------ |
             |                                 |

The thread does not continue until it receives the acknowledgement - this is to
prevent inconsistencies in state. For example, a call to create an inbox might
be followed by a query to determine whether there is data in it - the inbox
therefore must be fully set up before that query can be handled.

This is implemented by the _do_threadsafe() method. This method detects whether
it is being called from the same thread as the scheduler (by comparing thread
IDs). If it is not the same thread, then it puts a request into
self.threadtoaxonqueue and blocks on self.axontothreadqueue waiting for a reply.
The request is simply a tuple of a method or object to call and the associated
arguments. When _localmain() collects the request it issues the call and
responds with the return value.

self.pause() is overridden and equivalent functionality reimplemented by
blocking the thread on a threading.Event() object which can be signalled by
_localmain() whenever the thread ought to wake up.


The 'Adaptive' version does *not* ensure the resource tracking and retrieval
methods thread safe. This is because it is assumed these will only be accessed
internally by the component itself from within its separate thread. _localmain()
does not touch these resources.


XXX *TODO*: Thread shutdown - no true support for killing threads in python
            (if ever). stop() method therefore doesn't stop the thread. Only
            stops the internal _localmain() microprocess, which therefore cuts
            the thread off from communicating with the rest of the system.
