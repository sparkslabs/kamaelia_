Multi-source Raw Audio Mixer
============================

A component that mixes raw audio data from an unknown number of sources, that
can change at any time. Audio data from each source is buffered until a minimum
threshold amount, before it is included in the mix. The mixing operation is a
simple addition. Values are not scaled down.



Example Usage
-------------

Mixing between 0 and 3 sources of audio (sometimes a source is active, sometimes
it isn't)::

    Graphline(
        MIXER = RawAudioMixer( sample_rate=8000,
                               channels=1,
                               format="S16_LE",
                               readThreshold=1.0,
                               bufferingLimit=2.0,
                               readInterval=0.1),
                             ),
        A = pipeline( SometimesOn_RawAudioSource(), Entuple(prefix="A") ),
        B = pipeline( SometimesOn_RawAudioSource(), Entuple(prefix="B") ),
        C = pipeline( SometimesOn_RawAudioSource(), Entuple(prefix="C") ),
            
        OUTPUT = RawSoundOutput( sample_rate=8000,
                                 channels=1
                                 format="S16_LE",
                               ),
               linkages = {
                   (A, "outbox") : (MIXER, "inbox"),
                   (B, "outbox") : (MIXER, "inbox"),
                   (C, "outbox") : (MIXER, "inbox"),
                   
                   (MIXER, "outbox") : (OUTPUT, "inbox"),
               },
             ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

If a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished message is received on this
component's "control" inbox this component will cease reading in data from any
audio sources. If it is currently outputting audio from any of its buffers, it
will continue to do so until these are empty. The component will then forward
on the shutdown message it was sent, out of its "signal" outbox and immediately
terminate.


TODO:

    * Needs a timeout mechanism to discard very old data (otherwise this is
      effectively a memory leak!)
"""


# dynamic audio downmixer

# this component takes in raw 1 channel S16_LE audio chunks
# each chunk must be framed with a unique source identifier
#     (srcId, audiodata)
#
#
# this component maintains buffering buckets for each source
# it mixes together all sources for which it has data at the time
# if a given buffer bucket overflows, then the oldest data is dropped

# a buffering bucket doesn't start to be read from until it has reached a minimum
# threshold amount of data; after which it remains 'active' until it empties
