======================================================
Breaks data into chunks matching a required chunk rate
======================================================

Send data, such as binary strings to this component and it will break it down
to roughly constant sized chunks, to match a required 'rate' of chunk emission.

This is not about 'real time' chunking of a live data source, but is instead
about precisely chunking data that you know has been generated, or will be
consumed, at a particular rate.

You specify the 'rate' of the incoming data and the rate you want chunks
sent out at. RateChunker will determine what size the chunks need to be,
applying dynamic rounding to precisely match the rate without drift over time.




Example Usage
-------------

Chunking a stream of 48KHz 16bit stereo audio into 25 chunks per second of audio
data (one chunk for each frame of a corresponding piece of 25fps video)::

    bps = bytesPerSample = 2*2

    Pipeline( AudioSource(),
              RateChunker(datarate=48000*bps, quantasize=bps, chunkrate=25),
              ...
            )

The quanta size ensures that the chunks RateChunker sends out always contain a
whole number of samples (4 bytes per sample).



Behaviour
---------

At initialisation, specify:
    
  * the rate of the incoming data (eg. bytes/second)
  * the required rate of outgoing chunks of data
  * the minimum quanta size (see below)

Send slicable data items, such as strings containing binary data to the "inbox"
inbox. The same data is sent out of the "outbox" outbox, rechunked to meet the
required chunk rate.

The outgoing chunk sizes are dynamically varied to match the required chunk rate
as accurately as possible. The quantasize parameter dictates the minimum unit by
which the chunksize will be varied.

For example, for 16bit stereo audio data, there are 4 bytes per sample, so
a quantasize of 4 should be specified, to make sure samples remain whole.

If a producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the
"control" inbox. It is immediately sent on out of the "signal" outbox and the
component then immediately terminates.
