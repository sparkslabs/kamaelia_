Axon base classes
=================

What is defined here is a metaclass that is used as a base class for some key
classes in Axon.

It was originally created to allow super class calling in a slightly nicer
manner in terms of syntactic sugar easier to get right that still
has the good effects of "super" in a multiple inheritance scenario. **Use of
this particular feature has been deprecated** because of more subtle issues in
inheritance situations.

However this metaclass has been retained (and is still used) for possible future
uses.

* AxonObject is the base class for Axon.Microprocess.microprocess and
  Axon.Linkage.linkage
