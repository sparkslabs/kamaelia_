/Sketches/filereading/ReadFileAdapter.py:

 This file has been retired.
 It is retired because it is now part of the main code base.
 If you want to use this, you should be using Kamaelia.File.Reading
    ReadFileAdapter here is named PromptedFileReader there

 This file now deliberately exits to encourage you to fix your code :-)
 (Hopefully contains enough info to help you fix it)
