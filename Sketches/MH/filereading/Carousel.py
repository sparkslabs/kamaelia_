    """Encapsulates a changing carousel of components. The current component is wired
       such that it's inbox and outbox are exported  as "inbox" and "outbox".
       When the component emits producerFinished on its 'signal' output, a 'next' message is
       sent from 'requestNext'.

       Whenever arguments are received on 'next' eg. (but not necessarily) in response to
       a 'next' request, the components are destroyed and replaced with new ones, created
       with the arguments specified.

       After initialisation, Carousel will wait for the first  set of instructions, unless you
       set the make1stRequest argument, in which case it will issue a 'next' request immediately

       A factory method that takes a single argument should be supplied to create the components
       for the carousel.
       If you want to support more complex argument forms, you'll need to put a wrapper in.
