    """\
    HTTPRequestHandler() -> new HTTPRequestHandler component capable of fulfilling the requests
    received over a single connection after they have been parsed by HTTPParser
    
    
    How does it work?
    ========================
    Both requests and responses are handled in a stepwise manner (as opposed to processing a
    whole request or response in one go) to reduce latency and cope well with bottlenecks.

    One request handler (self.handler) component is used per request - the particular 
    component instance (including parameters, componetn state) is picked by HTTPResourceGlue.
    Generally you will have a handler spawned for each new request, terminating after completing
    the sending of the response. However, it is also possible to use a 'persistent' component
    if you do the required jiggery-pokery to make sure that at any one time this component is
    not servicing more than one request simultaenously ('cause it wouldn't work).
    
    What does it support?
    ========================
    
    Components as request handlers (hurrah!).
    
    3 different ways in which the response data (body) can be terminated
    -- Chunked transfer encoding --
    This is the most complex of the 3 ways and was introduced in HTTP/1.1. Its performance is
    slightly worse that the other 2 as multiple length-lines have to be added to the data stream.
    
    -- Explicit length --
    This is the easiest of the 3 ways but requires the length of the response to be known before
    it is sent. It uses a header 'Content-Length' to indicate this value.
    This method is prefered for any response whose length is known in advance.
    
    -- Connection: close --
    This method closes (or half-closes) the TCP connection when the response is complete.
    This is highly inefficient when the client wishes to download several resources as a new
    TCP connection must be created and destroyed for each resource. This method is retained for
    HTTP/1.0 compatibility.
    It is however preferred for responses that do not have a true end, e.g. a continuous stream
    over HTTP as the alternative, chunked transfer encoding, has poorer performance.
    
    The choice of these three methods is determined at runtime by the characteristics of the
    first response part produced by the request handler and the version of HTTP that the client
    supports (chunked requires 1.1 or higher).
    
    What may need work?
    ========================
    - HTTP standard compliance (e.g. handling of version numbers for a start)
    - Requests for byte ranges, cache control (though these may be better implemented
      in each request handler)
    - Performance tuning
    - Prevent many MBs of data being queued up because TCPClient finds it has a slow
      upload to the remote host
