========================
Authenticator Component
========================
Authenticator is server side component of authentication. After
successful authentication, the process acts as a passthrough
for encrypted (data+session packets)

How does it work ?
------------------
The authentication process is based on the Needham-Scroeder protocol.
Authentication Sequence
1. The Authenticatee sends its Userid encrypted with root key.
2. The Authenticator obtains userid by decrypting the data received and
   looks up for the key corresponding to the user id. 
3. The Authenticator generates a random number, encrypts it
   with a user's key and sends it to the authenticatee.
4. The Authenticatee decrypts it, increments it by 1 and sends it back
   to the Authenticator. 
5. The Authenticator verifies if the number recieved is indeed the original
   number incremented by 1.
6. Authenticator sends SUCCESS Message
7. Authenticator waits for Authenticatee to send OK acknowledgement
8. After receiving acknowledgement, it sends new userid message to
   "notifyuser" outbox
9. It then subscribes to DataManagement backplane
10. It links its outbox with DataManagement subscribes outbox there by
   the encrypted (data + session keys) acting as passthrough
"""

#TODO:
#currently uses xtea as the encryption algorithm for challenge response
#communication. need to refactor to be able to plugin various ciphers
#Should be able to extend and override new authentication mechanisms
