TV Bookmarks
- Program designed to grab RDF data from BBC /programmes and use it to identify relevant conversation using the Twitter streaming API.
- Data is then saved and analysed to create bookmarks in programmes which can be jumped to via the iPlayer interface.
- Data will at a later date be enriched to provide some form of explanation to users, identifying why it forms a relevant bookmark.
- Could also be used to give a live activity EPG with heavily discussed programmes highlighted

Installing
- DB schema MUST be imported from the included SQL file BEFORE executing the Django DB sync as Django can't get it quite right
- A copy of the included twitter-login.conf.dist must be modified and copied to your home directory with the name twitter-login.conf

Running
- From the console, type 'python Bookmarks.py' and hit enter, or if the file has executable permissions, simply enter './Bookmarks.py'

Other Information
- During the running of the program, it will create a file called tempRDF.txt in the running directory to hold the most recently downloaded RDF data/
- contentDebug.txt may also be created to keep track of in-stream messages from Twitter.
- It will also create files called namecache.conf, linkcache.conf and oversizedtweets.conf in your home directory

namecache.conf - Holds a cache linking people's names to their Twitter screen names if they exist to prevent re-querying.
               - Can be flushed periodically to enable grabbing of new Twitter users (shouldn't happen too frequently).

linkcache.conf - Holds a cache linking http://bbc.in URLs to their bbc.co.uk representation.
               - These will never change and as a result the cache should never be flushed.

oversizedtweets.conf - Holds any tweets which exceed the database limitation for storage of the JSON representation.
                     - This has never happened as yet, but the file remains for debugging purposes.

contentDebug.txt - Stored in the running directory. Keeps track of 'delete', 'scrub_geo' and 'limit' messages from Twitter for debugging.
