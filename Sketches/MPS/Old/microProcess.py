"""
Early test to see how viable generators were (on a fairly low end machine)

Simple program to text microprocesses and speed of context switching

This turns out to be a very fast method of introducing parallelism in a
highly lightweight, readable and scalable manner.

Results:
Num processes	#Switches/sec	Memory
3		23000		Low
100		23000		Low
1000		23000		2-3Mb
50000		22000		50Mb

ie about 1Mb per thousand microprocesses.

The idea of usage would be this:

	* You create a class that contains a "main" method, inheriting
	  from microprocess.
	* You then create instances of that class which you then give a
	  thread of control
	* You pass these threads of control to a "runner" which then runs
	  the threads, and handles IPC between the two.

	   For a class to be runnable in this system, it simply needs to inherit
	   from this. It needs to be given a thread of control after this.

	   Attributes associated with a microprocess are:
			* microprocess id (mpid) - an internally assigned integer
			* name - if provided
			* inbox - this currently a linear - designed to be used as a FIFO.

		Microprocesses also have 2 statuses:
			* Runnable - the process gets cycles if this is true.
			* Stopped - the process has its thread of control removed if this is true

	   The mpid or name can be used in IPC, and a microprocess can ask
	   the system to awaken it when things things happen it's interested in.
	   We may extend this to it being awakened when it is sent messages. (maybe)

	 There is one class variable:
	 	maxid

	This is used to keep track of the last highest mpid. At present mpids are not reused,
	they might be in future.

			* id - system assigned numeric mpid, based on class variable "maxid".
			* runnable - Flag to indicate whether this microprocess is runnable.
			   the idea is that processes can go to sleep and be awakened.
			* stopped - Flag to indicate the microprocess has come to a halt. It's thread
			   of control should be removed at the next available opportunity.
			* name - A user assigned name for this process.
			* inbox - This is a linear() type that contains new messages from other
			   microprocesses. Messages should be taken out of the inbox using
			   the "shift" method of the inbox. (probably change.) Not sure if just want
			   one inbox, or more than one at present. I'm suspecting we may actually
			   want more than one, and for them to be named.
			* outbox - A Linear type that contains new messages to be sent to other
			   microprocesses. Messages are added to the outbox using an append
			   method. Not entirely sure if a good idea at present :-)
