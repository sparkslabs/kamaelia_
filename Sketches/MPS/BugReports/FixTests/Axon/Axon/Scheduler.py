====================================
Scheduler - runs things concurrently
====================================

The Scheduler runs active microprocesses - giving a regular timeslice to each.
It also provides the ability to pause and wake them; allowing an Axon based
system to play nicely and relinquish the cpu when idle.

* The Scheduler runs microprocesses that have been 'activated'
* The Scheduler is itself a microprocess



Using the scheduler
-------------------

The simplest way is to just use the default scheduler ``scheduler.run``.
Simply activate components or microprocesses then call the runThreads() method
of the scheduler::

    from Axon.Scheduler import scheduler
    from MyComponents import MyComponent, AnotherComponent
    
    c1 = MyComponent().activate()
    c2 = MyComponent().activate()
    c3 = AnotherComponent().activate()

    scheduler.run.runThreads()


Alternatively you can create a specific scheduler instance, and activate
them using that specific scheduler::

    mySched = scheduler()

    c1 = MyComponent().activate(Scheduler=mySched)
    c2 = MyComponent().activate(Scheduler=mySched)
    c3 = AnotherComponent().activate(Scheduler=mySched)

    mySched.runThreads()


The runThreads() method is the way of bootstrapping the scheduler. Being a
microprocess, it needs something to schedule it! The runThreads() method does
exactly that.

The activate() method is fully thread-safe. It can handle multiple simultaneous
callers from different threads to the one the scheduler is running in.



Pausing and Waking microprocesses
---------------------------------

The Scheduler supports the ability to, in a thread safe manner, pause and wake
individual microprocesses under its control. Because it is thread safe, any
thread of execution can issue pause and wake requests for any scheduled
microprocess.

The pauseThread() and wakeThread() methods submit requests to pause or wake
microprocesses. The scheduler will process these when it is next able to - the
requests are queued rather than processed immediately. This is done to ensure
thread safety. It can handle multiple simultaneous callers from different
threads to the one the scheduler is running in.

Pausing a microprocess means the scheduler removes it from its 'run queue'. This
means that it no longer executes that microprocess. Waking it puts it back into
the 'run queue'.

If no microprocesses are awake then the scheduler relinquishes cpu usage by
blocking.

If however this scheduler is itself being scheduled by another microprocess then
it does not block. Ideally it should ask its scheduler to pause it, but instead
it busy-waits - self pausing functionality is not yet implemented.



'yielding' new components for activation and replacement generators
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, the main() generator in a microprocess (its thread of execution)
can return any values it likes when it uses the ``yield`` statement. It is
recommended to not yield zeros or other kinds of 'false' value as these are
reserved for possible future special meaning.

However, this scheduler does understand certain values that can be yielded:

* **Axon.Ipc.newComponent** - a microprocess can yield this to ask the scheduler
  to activate a new component or microprocess::

        def main(self):
            ...
            x=MyComponent()
            yield Axon.Ipc.newComponent(x)
            ...
      
  This is simply an alternative to calling x.activate().

* **Axon.Ipc.WaitComplete** - this is a way for a microprocess to substitute
  itself (temporarily) with another one that uses a new generator.
  For example::

        def main(self):
            ...
            yield Axon.Ipc.WaitComplete(self.waitOneSecond())
            ...

        def waitOneSecond(self):
            t=time.time()
            while time.time() < t+1.0:
                yield 1

  This is a convenient way to modularise parts of your main() code. But there
  is an important limitation with the current implementation:

  * self.pause() will not cause the replacement generator to pause. (Where
    'self' is the original microprocess - as in the example code above)



What happens when a microprocess finishes?
------------------------------------------

The scheduler will stop running it! It will call the microprocess's stop()
method. It will also call the _closeDownMicroprocess() method and will act on
the return value if it is one of the following:

* **Axon.Ipc.shutdownMicroprocess** - the specified microprocess will also be
  stopped. Use with caution as the implementation is currently untested and
  likely to fail, possibly even crash the scheduler!

* **Axon.Ipc.reactivate** - the specified microprocess will be (re)activated.
  The scheduler uses this internally to pick up where it left off when a
  Axon.Ipc.WaitComplete instigated detour finishes (see above).

  

Querying the scheduler (Introspection)
--------------------------------------

The listAllThreads() method returns a list of all activated microprocesses -
both paused and awake.

The isThreadPaused() method lets you determine if an individual microprocess is
paused. Note that the result returned by this method is conservative (the
default assumption is that a thread is probably awake). the result will vary
depending on the exact moment it is called!

Both these methods are thread safe.



Slowing down execution (for debugging)
--------------------------------------

It also has a slow motion mode designed to help with debugging & testing. Call
runThreads() with the slowmo argument set to the number of seconds the scheduler
should pause after each cycle of executing all microprocesses. For example, to
wait half a second after each cycle of execution::

    scheduler.run.runThreads(slowmo=0.5)



How does it work internally?
----------------------------

The scheduler keeps the following internal state:

* **time** - updated to time.time() every execution cycle - can be inspected by
  microprocesses instead of having to call time.time() themselves.
    
* **threads** - a dictionary containing the state of activated microprocesses
  (whether they are awake or not)

* **wakeRequests** and **pauseRequests** - the thread safe queues of requests to
  wake and pause individual microprocesses

* Internal to the main() generator:
    
  * **runqueue** - the list of active and awake microprocesses being run

  * **nextrunqueue** - the list of microprocesses to be run next time round

The scheduler uses a simple round robin approach - it walks through its run
queue and calls the next() method of each microprocess in turn. As it goes, it
builds a new run queue, ready for the next cycle. If a microprocess terminates
(raises a StopIteration exception) then it is not included in the next cycle's
run queue.

After it has gone through all microprocesses, the scheduler then processes
messages in its wakeRequests and sleepRequests queues. Sleep requests are
processed first; then wake requests second. Suppose there is a sleep and wake
request queued for the same microprocess; should it be left awake or put to
sleep? By processing wake requests last, the scheduler can err on the side of
caution and prefer to leave it awake.

Microprocesses are all in one of three possible states (recorded in the
``threads`` dictionary):
    
* **ACTIVE** - the microprocess is awake. It should be in the run queue being
  prepared for the next execution cycle.

* **SLEEPING** - the microprocess is asleep/paused. It should *not* be in the
  run queue for the next cycle.

* **GOINGTOSLEEP** - the microprocess has been requested to be put to sleep.

A request to put a microprocess to sleep is handled as follows:
    
* If the microprocess is already *sleeping*, then nothing needs to happen.

* If the microprocess is *active*, then it is changed to "going to sleep". It
  is not removed from the run queue immediately. Instead, what happens is:

   * on the next cycle of execution, as the scheduler goes through items in the
     run queue, it doesn't execute any that are "going to sleep" and doesn't
     include them in the next run queue it is building. It also sets them to the
     "sleeping" state,

Wake requests are used to both wake up sleeping microprocesses and also to
activate new ones. A request to wake a microprocess is handled like this:

* If the microprocess is already *active*, then nothing needs to happen.

* If the microprocess is *sleeping* then it is added to the next run queue and
  changed to be *active*.

* If the microprocess is *going to sleep* then it is only changed to be *active*
  (it will already be in the run queue, so doesn't need to be added)

If the request contains a flag indicating that this is actually an activation
request, then this also happens:
  
* If the microprocess is not in the ``threads`` dictionary then it is added to
  both the run queue and ``threads``. It is set to be *active*.

This three state system is a performance optimisation: it means that the
scheduler does not need to waste time searching through the next run queue to
remove items - they simply get removed on the next cycle of execution.

Wake requests and sleep requests are handled through thread-safe queues. This
enables other threads of execution (eg. threaded components) to safely make
requests to wake or pause components.
