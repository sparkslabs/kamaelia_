===========================================
Peer-to-Peer Streaming System (client part)
===========================================
This example demonstrates the use of BitTorrent and HTTP to download, share
reconstruct a data stream in real-time.
It expects a webserver hosting a folder that contains:

- meta.txt (a file containing the number of chunks/torrents in the stream 
            so far as a decimal, ASCII string)
            
- 1.torrent
- 2.torrent
-    ...
- 123.torrent (if meta.txt contained "123")

Only this metainfo is downloaded using HTTP. The stream itself is downloaded
(and uploaded to other downloaders) using BitTorrent.
Other users must upload the stream's chunks using BitTorrent for this demo
to work.
To listen to/view the stream, just point your favourite media player
(say, XMMS) at the reconstructed file after it's been downloading for a minute
or so.
