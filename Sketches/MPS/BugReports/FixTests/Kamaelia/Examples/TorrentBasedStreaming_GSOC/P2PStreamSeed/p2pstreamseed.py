===========================================
Peer-to-Peer Streaming System (server part)
===========================================
This example demonstrates the use of BitTorrent and HTTP to distribute
a data stream in real-time. Specifically, this example redistributes
a SHOUTcast or Icecast audio/video stream of the user's choice.
It expects a webserver hosting a script which saves data POST'd to it
as N.torrent where N is the number of POST requests it has seen before
this one + 1. This script should also write this value N as a decimal,
ASCII string to a file meta.txt in the same directory also available
from the webserver using HTTP.

i.e. the script should produce:
- meta.txt (a file containing the number of torrents in the stream 
            so far as a decimal, ASCII string)
            
- 1.torrent
- 2.torrent
-    ...
- 100.torrent (if meta.txt contained "100")

Only this metainfo is downloaded using HTTP. The stream itself is transmitted
using the BitTorrent protocol.

Usage
==============
- Choose an Icecast/SHOUTcast stream that you are legally permitted
  to redistribute and allow others to redistribute.

- Setup a BitTorrent tracker.

- Setup an HTTP server to host the .torrent files.

- Put an upload script on the HTTP server to save .torrent files sent to it.
  (e.g. the PHP script torrentupload.php in this directory)
  
- Run this example.

- Enter the URL of the stream.

- Enter the 'announce' URL of your BitTorrent tracker, which is typically
  "http://yourtrackerhostname:trackerportnumber/announce".
  e.g. "http://www.example.org:6969/announce"
  
- Enter the URL of your upload script.

- Give others the URL of folder on your webserver to which .torrent files
  are saved.
  
- Have them run the example in ../P2PStreamPeer/ on their computer.

- Have them open "myreconstructedstream.mp3" with an MP3 player program.

- They will download and reshare (upload) your stream automatically.

Note: A sensible bitrate for the stream is just under the average upload speed
in the swarm (i.e. of you and all peers downloading your stream).
Typically for broadband this would be 180 kilobits/s = 22.5 kilobytes/s
Your upload speed MUST be larger than this.
