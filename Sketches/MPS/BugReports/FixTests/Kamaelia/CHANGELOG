   * Kamaelia/Visualisation/Axon/ExtraWindowFurniture.py
     Added in the facility to pull in the official, installed Kamaelia
     logo as well as from the local directory, or just not at all.

   * Kamaelia/Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/Multiclick.py -
     Added outbox pygamesignal - to avoid accidental bugs when used in a pipeline

   * Minor bugfix to SSL support

   * Kamaelia.UI.Pygame.Text Added - (similar to Ticker, but input as well
     as output. Line oriented rather than word)

   * Added support for client side IRC
      * Kamaelia/Protocol/IRC/IRCClient.py provides core client side
        protocol handling as well as a prefab for connecting to a particular
        IRC server.
      * Kamaelia/Support/Protocol/IRC.py contains support code for building
        clients that use the IRCClient - specifically for sending messages
        of the right type.
      * Examples/TCP_Systems/IRC/BasicDemo.py - contains a basic example.

   * Added minor bugfix for Windows support for TCP clients

   NEW TOOLS:

   Simple Video Player:
    * plays the sound and pictures from a video file

   Video Reframer:
    * applies an XML edit decision list to cut, crop and scale a video sequence;
      reframing the content for other use.

   Video Shot Change Detector:
    * outputs an XML file describing the frame indices at which shot changes
      probably occur in a sequence of video


   NEW COMPONENTS:

    * WAV format parsing and writing
    * YUV4MPEG2 format parsing and writing
    * Additional UnixProcess component with named pipe support
    * Various simple utility components
    * Pygame Video Surfaces (as opposed to overlays)

    * Video frame cropping and scaling
    * Experimental Pipeline/Graphline/Carousel support for size limited inboxes
    * Sequencing of tasks (Seq component)


   Changed the CSA such that it no longer has internal buffering. This means
   that if you make the link *TO* the CSA synchronous that you will be able
   to send to the link as fast as the link will handle without causing over
   buffering.

   Bugfixes to:
    * Kamaelia.Chassis.Carousel component - rewrite to fix shutdown behaviour.

   Bugfixes to:
    * Kamaelia.UI.Pygame.BasicSprite component.
    * Kamaelia.Util.RateFilter.ByteRate_RequestControl component.
    * Kamaelia.Protocol.HTTP.HTTPClient.SimpleHTTPClient component.

   Added Documentation generation tools for generating Axon and Kamaelia
   reference documentation - see their docstrings for more information.

   Enhanced Kamaelia.Support.Data.Repository to support fuller introspection
   of components, prefabs, classes and methods in the repository, including
   their arguments and documentation. The "Compose" tool now uses this,
   instead of trying to import all components.

   Dirac 0.6.0 release now supported by Dirac components (through 0.6.0
   bindings)

   Bugfixes to:
    * Kamaelia.Audio.PyMedia.Input component now works on win32

   Shutdown handling improved for internet components: CSA, TCPClient,
   and TCPServer. Shutting down capability added to the Selector component.

   Documentation improved for DVB components, and parsing added for date and
   time DVB SI data.

   Documentation added to RawAudioMixer, and pymedia audio components.

   NEW EXAMPLES:

   OPEN GL:
    * Stub test code from the OpenGL components have been separated out as
      lots of mini examples:

      Moved Tools/Whiteboard/Tokenisation.py into
         Kamaelia/Util/Tokenisation/Simple.py

0.5.0

   Kamaelia 0.5.0 adds a large number of new components, many of which have
   been developed by students participating in Google's Summer Of Code 2006
   Programme. There are many new examples demonstrating these new features.

   Additionsfrom SoC 2006:
    * Modular http web server and client
    * BitTorrent client
    * OpenGL display components

   Other additions include:   
    * PyMedia Audio IO and codec access
    * Speex audio codec
    * Audio mixing and filtering
    * Improved Digital TV handling


   NEW EXAMPLES:

   DVB Digital TV timeshifting tools:
    * Examples/DVB_Systems/RecordNamedChanel.py
    * Examples/DVB_Systems/PersonalVideoRecorder.py

   
   HTTP PROTOCOL SERVER AND CLIENT

   New components add a modular HTTP server and client compoents, including
   a Icecast/SHOUTcast client. The HTTP server is modular, and can be
   configured to instantiate different protocol handler components depending
   on the request URL.

   For more details see: ./Examples/SoC2006/RJL/README-HTTP


   BITTORRENT CLIENT INTEGRATION

   These components add a fully fledged BitTorrent peer, capable of both
   downloading and serving to peers.

   These components require the BitTorrent _sources_ to be installed. It has
   been tested with version 4.20.8 - use this version or later only.
   Get the latest sources from: http://download.bittorrent.com/dl/?M=D

   Some people have reported problems with more recent versions (regarding a
   missing or misplaced language translations file). Try reverting to version
   4.20.8 if you encounter difficulties.

   For more details see: ./Examples/SoC2006/RJL/README-BitTorrent      


   OPEN GL DISPLAY

   The range of Kamaelia UI capabilities now includes OpenGL. The design is
   similar to the way the existing PyGame display components work: A Display
   component provides a core display service and components wishing to
   render an OpenGL object use the service it provides.

   It includes an ability to 'wrap' existing PyGame components - enabling
   them to be displayed as a rectangle within an OpenGL space and to be
   interacted with (eg. they can receive mouse motion events, mapped back
   from 3d onto the 2d surface)

   A simple 'interactor' framework provides a way to script and control
   motion and transformation of OpenGL components.

   Components include: button, label, progress bar, and a 'wrapper' for
   bringing existing PyGame components.


   PYMEDIA AUDIO

   A new Kamaelia.Audio namespace has been added. The first components to
   populate this provide PyMedia based audio input, output, coding and
   decoding.

   PyMedia is a cross platform python library providing access to audio and
   video capture, codecs and playback. Get it from: http://www.pymedia.org/

   NOTE: With version 1.3.7.0 of pymedia, Linux users may experience segfaults
         whilst using the audio input component. A patch exists for pymedia
         to fix this. Get the patch here:
             http://kamaelia.sf.net/t/pymedia_patch.tar.gz
         

   SPEEX CODING AND DECODING

   A pair of components have been added that use the PySpeex library (version
   0.2) to add Speex encoding and decoding:

   Speex is an open source audio compresion format optimised for compressing
   speech content to very low bitrates (eg. 10kbit/s). Get it from
   http://www.speex.org


   DIGITAL TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION (DVB-T)

   There is now a wider set of Digital TV (DVB-T) support - with a richer
   and more complete set of components for demultiplexing and processing
   metadata within the stream.

   To support this, some experimental code for making public services
   (services registered under a name with the coordinating assistant tracker)
   easier to create and use has been implemented.

   Notable New Components:
    * DVB tuner, demuxer and receiver.
    * DVB data table reassembler
    * Various DVB data table parsers and pretty printers

   New Examples:
    * A channel recorder that works out itself, from the name of the channel
      what streams of data need recording from the broadcast multiplex.

    * A personal video recorder that records programmes specified by
      programme name and channel name.

0.4.0

   Kamaelia 0.4.0 is a consolidation, documentation and optimisation enhanced
   release. Whilst there are a wide variety of new components, existing
   functionality has been consolidated, and is now in use in a handful of
   (beta) production systems.

   Kamaelia 0.4.0 requires the use of Axon 1.5 (released at the same time as
   this release).

   Also, virtually all components now have highly detailed documentation inside
   their sourcefiles. A (large) subset of this is available here:
     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Components.html

   The examples have been duplicated onto the website, and are here:
     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Cookbook.html

   Our tutorial for helping getting started is here:
     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/MiniAxon/

   This has now been battle tested by a good few dozen people, and we feel is a
   good introduction to Kamaelia's approach, and others have also stated they
   find it a good way of understanding generators too. (even if they're not
   interested in Kamaelia)

   Notable New Components
     * Tools for Timeshifting Digital TV (DVB-T handling to be precise)
       These tools are only intended for use as legal under UK law, you need to
       check locally if you can use them.
     * A software data backplane
     * Tools for piping data easily/trivially through external processes
     * Tools for taking advantage of system optimisations allowing quiescent
       behaviour. (both in terms of pygame & network based systems)
     * Tools for using UDP

   New Examples
     * Tools for using UDP & SingleServer

     * A collaborative whiteboard "sketcher" which is both a server to other
       whiteboards and/or a client to other whiteboards. (Due to changes, when
       not in use CPU usage for these is as close to zero as it can be for any
       software) This is also a good example of usage of the backplane
       component.
       This application is particularly nice to use in conjunction with a
       tablet PC!
       An overview of the sketcher can be found on our systems page:

     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Systems.html
       (see Collaborative Whiteboarding)

     * Examples for using the tools for timeshifting including:

     * Tuning into a TV channel on Freeview and recording it to disk
     * Dumping a DVB multiplex transport stream
     * Demultiplexing a prestored DVB multiplex
       A system for grabbing a TV channel and it's now & next information, such
       that this can allow the programmes to be captured and transcoding as
       individual programmes for watching later.
       This is the core of the BBC Macro system (an internal prototype) that
       can be seen here:

     * http://bbc.kamaelia.org/cgi-bin/blog/blog.cgi

   An overview of the architecture can be found here:

     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/KamaeliaMacro.html

   Essentially, this allows you to build your own space efficient PVR.

   General overview of other large scale changes

   Massively improved documentation across the board (no file left untouched).
   This is all largely in the form of pydoc based documentation, a fair chunk
   of it is available at
     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Components.html

   However the documentation in those files goes further than that, including
   many, many more examples than are even at:
     * http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Cookbook.html

   Large scale removal of cruft and change over to use pipelines and graphlines
   where suitable. This is most noticable inside the examples.

   Code quality of a number of pieces of code has been improved:
     * A small number of components have been rewritten from the 3 callback
       form into the generator form of component to simplify their
       implementation.
     * Shutdown handling is now more consistent.
     * Some core components have been rewritten, test first, now that their
       expected usage is clearer, making the system more dependable.
     * Throughput handling has also generally been improved. Many locations
       where the following was written:

           if self.dataReady("inbox"):
               d = self.recv("inbox")
               e = SomeTransform(d)
               self.send(e, "outbox")

       We've discovered gain better throughput if you write:

           while self.dataReady("inbox"):
               d = self.recv("inbox")
               e = SomeTransform(d)
               self.send(e, "outbox")

     * Improved handling of child components, specific examplars are pipeline &
       graphline components.
     * Increased use of .activate() and .run() methods rather than manually
       using the Axon.Ipc.newComponent message of manually starting the
       scheduler.
     * Peppered through the code is some hints to improve introspection and
       detection of components for both code generation and interactive
       graphical pipeline builder applications. Example lines added to files:

           __kamaelia_components__ = ( Annotator, RecoverOrder, )
           __kamaelia_prefab__ = ( SRM_Sender, SRM_Receiver)

       These can be extracted using Kamaelia.Data.Repository

   Pygame related changes
     * Major changes to do with how components update the display. Specifically
       they MUST send redraw requests through. This is akin to doing a flip for
       the surfaces.
     * A private _PygameEventSource has also been created.

   These two changes combined allow the system to become quiescent, where
   possible.
     * A number of components now understand what to do if sent an alpha value
       on an alphacontrol inbox.

   Detailed Overview of other changes

   Initial release, largely rewritten or includes new components:
     * Examples/example13/UDP_demo.py
     * Examples/example15/Macro.py
     * Examples/example15/SingleChannelTransportStreamCapture.py
     * Examples/example15/TransportStreamCapture.py
     * Examples/example15/TransportStreamDemuxer.py
     * Kamaelia/Codec/__init__.py
     * Kamaelia/Community/__init__.py
     * Kamaelia/Data/Repository.py
     * Kamaelia/Data/tests/test_MimeDict.py
     * Kamaelia/Device/__init__.py
     * Kamaelia/Device/DVB/Core.py
     * Kamaelia/Device/DVB/EIT.py
     * Kamaelia/Device/DVB/__init__.py
     * Kamaelia/File/UnixPipe.py
     * Kamaelia/Internet/UDP.py
     * Kamaelia/Util/Backplane.py
     * Kamaelia/Util/Console.py
     * Kamaelia/Support/Tk/Scrolling.py
     * Kamaelia/Internet/ConnectedSocketAdapter.py
     * Kamaelia/Internet/Selector.py
     * Kamaelia/KamaeliaIPC.py
     * Kamaelia/Util/RateFilter.py

   Changed to take advantage of Axon changes allowing quiescent behaviour:
     * Kamaelia/Internet/ConnectedSocketAdapter.py
     * Kamaelia/Internet/Selector.py
     * Kamaelia/Chassis/ConnectedServer.py

   The selector and the CSA have been changed such that all socket specific
   behaviour has been shifted out of the selector into the CSA. This allows
   the selector to be used for files as well as sockets.

     Kamaelia/Internet/TCPClient.py

     Kamaelia/Internet/TCPServer.py

     Kamaelia/UI/PygameDisplay.py

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/Button.py

     Kamaelia/Util/Introspector.py
       Specifically, utilising an addition to scheduler's API to allow 'proper'
       extraction of running components, without having to climb around
       naughtily inside data structures.

   New/Changed functionality to existing components:
     * Kamaelia/Visualisation/PhysicsGraph/TopologyViewerComponent.py
     * Kamaelia/Visualisation/PhysicsGraph/chunks_to_lines.py
     * Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/Ticker.py
     * Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/KeyEvent.py
     * Tools/PipeBuilder/GUI.py
     * Tools/VisualPipeBuilder.py (no longer uses a hardcoded list of
       components)
     * Examples/example10/SimpleDiracPlayer.py

   Namespace cleanup:
     * Kamaelia/Util/ConsoleEcho.py --> Kamaelia/Util/Console.py
     * Kamaelia/SimpleServer.py --> Kamaelia/Chassis/ConnectedServer.py
     * The marshalling code in util has had a similar change.

0.3.0

   Added Files:
     * Examples/example10/SimpleDiracEncodeDecode.py

     * Simple dirac base encode/decode chain.

     Examples/example10/SimpleDiracPlayer.py
     * Simple dirac player. Shows how to play a specific file.

     Examples/example11/Ticker.py
     * Simple example showing how to use the ticker. First developed for
       showing subtitles.

     Examples/example12/SimpleMultiFileStreamer.py
     * Simple streamer that repeatedly streams (3 times) the same audio
       file.
     * This is a mainly a demonstration of how to use the
       JoinChooserToCarousel Chassis, and the
       FixedRateControlledReusableFileReader
     * What really happens is a "chooser" takes a playlist of things to
       serve, and the filereader asks the chooser what file it should be
       reading next when it finishes reading a file.

     Examples/example12/ClientStreamToFile.py
     * Simple client for the above streamer

     Examples/example4/MulticastStreamingSystem_SRM.py
     * This is a modification to the multicast streaming system that uses
       the SimpleReliableMulticast protocol, to add a thin skein of
       reliability over multicast. Passes basic lab tests, but needs real
       world testing to be certain.

     Examples/example9/Simplegame.py
     * Simple bouncing images game. Designed for very small children who are
       amused by things take beep and react when you press left/right mouse
       buttons.
     * Forms a demonstration of the new BasicSprite and SpriteScheduler
       components, along with the associated EventHandler code, which is a
       substantial subsystem. Shutdown of active bouncing sprites and their
       associated components controlling them is controlled by a fanout
       component. Also contains a nice demonstration of the flexibility of
       Graphline

     Kamaelia/Chassis/Carousel.py
     * A carousel chassis gets it's name from broadcast carousels. A
       broadcast carousel is where a programme or set of programmes, is
       broadcast one after another after another, often on a loop. (The
       canonical UK example here is ceefax/teletext) Movie channels which
       show the same film over and over are another form of carousel.
       If this makes no sense, consider a file reader. It reads a file and
       then it's done. Logically we can create a component that receives a
       set of filenames (and perhaps other arguments) and then creates a
       file reader for each on, one after another. The output from the file
       reader is then made the output for that component. If a carousel is
       provided with a filereader component, this is precisely the
       functionality you get. You gain reusability from things that are not
       directly reusable and normally come to a halt.

     Kamaelia/Chassis/ConnectedServer.py
     * A chassis is a component that can have other components attached or
       plugin to it. The existing SimpleServer is just that - it takes a
       protocol handler class such that when a connection is made an
       instance of the protocol handler is created to handle the connection.
       This menas it has components attached to it. We also note that the
       SimpleServer is a special case of a connected server, as a result the
       old Kamaelia.SimpleServer.SimpleServer class now resides in
       Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer.SimpleServer

     Kamaelia/Chassis/Prefab.py
     * This will be a collection of functions that act as prefabs. That is
       they take a collection of arguments that will be linked up in a
       standardised way. This makes them a specialised form of chassis
     * JoinChooserToCarousel Automated "What are arguments should I use next
       time for my reusable component?" prefab.
       Takes a carousel that will repeatedly create components of particular
       type. It asks the chooser what the arguments should be for the next
       item.
       Purpose of carousel : Repeatedly creates a component. It creates the
       component with a set of arguments. The magic is that it can recieve
       those arguments on "next" inbox. Further magic: it can ask something
       else to give it it's "next" set of argument. Purpose of chooser : To
       step through a list of things given to it. When asked "what next" it
       provides the next in the list.
       Combination, for example, allows you to wire up a playlist to
       something reusable that reads files at a given rate.

     Kamaelia/Codec/Dirac.py
     * Provides dirac encoding & decoding components. The output of the
       dirac decoder matches that of the RawYUV framer

     Kamaelia/Codec/RawYUVFramer.py
     * Takes raw YUV data as read from a file and forms frames suitable for
       passing to (for example) a pygame video overlay.

     Kamaelia/Data/Escape.py
     * Contains data escaping functions used by the components that form the
       SimpleReliableMulticast protocol.

     Kamaelia/Data/Rationals.py
     * Data types & conversion functions used by the Dirac encoder/decoder

     Kamaelia/File/Reading.py
     * Provide a variety of new tools for handling different file reading
       issues. These have not (yet) entirely replaced the original
       ReadFileAdaptor.

     Kamaeli/File/Writing.py
     * Initial tools for writing to files

     Kamaelia/Internet/Simulate/BrokenNetwork.py
     * Components created during testing of the simple reliable multicast.
       They force out of order lossy delivery with duplicates added.

     Kamaelia/Protocol/Framing.py
     * Deals with identifcation and verification that data frames are a
       certain size. (Assists detection of packetloss/duplication)
     * Also provides chunking facilities for identifying start & end points
       in a chunk

     Kamaelia/Protocol/SimpleReliableMulticast.py
     * Implements a simple protocol for introducing a level of reliability
       into multicast. Includes full coverage testing.

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/BasicSprite.py
     * Currently lower level than PygameDisplay related components
     * Initial implementation of a sprite component which has a number of
       controls:

     * Inboxes=["rotator", -- current rotation (in degrees)
       "translation", -- Control sprite's current position
       "scaler", -- Control how large the sprite's inmage is scaled
       "imaging", -- Control which image is currently displayed.
       "inbox",
       "control"]

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/EventHandler.py
     * Currently lower level than PygameDisplay related components
     * Simple tool for handling events

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/KeyEvent.py
     * Pygame display level component for ndependently handling key strokes.
       You may add a list of outboxes, and have a message sent to a given
       outbox when the key is pressed. This can be used for games,
       slideshows, and other things that are key activated.

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/SpriteScheduler.py
     * This is a specialised scheduler that provides sprites' logic with a
       timeslice by calling the sprite's update method. (Thereby also
       visually updating the sprite)

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/VideoOverlay.py
     * Provides a useful video playback tool. Video overlays can accept YUV
       data (as comes from many codecs) and display it without
       transformation.

     Kamaelia/UI/Tk/TkWindow.py
     * Provides the base level of integration required for TK based widgets.
       This allows for Tk based guis to be implemented and integrated
       trivially into Kamaelia with callbacks mapped to events. This was a
       simple first pass and has proved remarkably resilient.

     Kamaelia/Util/Fanout.py
     * Another simple splitter. The reason for allowing a variety of
       splitters is to see which approach/metaphor works best before
       limiting implementations. The usecases of each will need to be
       supportable by any resulting system.

     Kamaelia/Util/FilterComponent.py
     * Implements a generic filter system.

     Kamaelia/Util/Marshalling.py
     * The Marshalling/DeMarshalling Component is given a simple class. It
       then expects to be passed objects of that class, and then performs
       the following actions: __str__ on an object and fromString on an
       object. The idea is that you would place this between your logic and
       a network socket, which simply serialises and deserialises objects
       for transmission over the wire. The initial data format this is
       designed to work with is the MimeDict object.

     Kamaelia/Util/RateFilter.py
     * Provides a variety of tools for time based message limitation. Either
       in terms of byte count, raw message rate and so on. MessageRateLimit,
       ByteRate_RequestControl, VariableByteRate_RequestControl

     Tools/VisualPipeBuilder.py
     * Script that runs a pipebuilder. This is very much a version 0.1 tool,
       and only handles pipelines. It is however pretty useful.

     Tools/PipeBuilder/BuildViewer.py
     * Support file - builds a specialised topology viewer - for example
       using a crawling dashed line to indicate dataflow direction

     Tools/PipeBuilder/GUI.py
     * Builds the Tk based interface for the pipe builder. This includes the
       source code display window/widget and the main component display
       widget.

     Tools/PipeBuilder/PipeBuild.py

     Tools/PipeBuilder/PipelineWriter.py
     * Based on the topology, writes out python code.

   Changed files:
     * setup.py

     * Added:

     * Kamaelia.Codec
     * Kamaelia.Chassis
     * Kamaelia.File
     * Kamaelia.UI.Tk

     Examples/example8/slideshow.py
     * Now looks in the local "Slides" directory for slides to show.

     Kamaelia/SimpleServerComponent.py
     * Changed to a stub file that for now has compatibility imports from
       the new location Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer

     Kamaelia/SingleServer.py
     * In/outboxes now documented as to purposes

     Kamaelia/UI/PygameDisplay.py
     * Support for overlays added
     * Overlays are displayed *after* the other surfaces are rendered
     * Display tries to be doublebuffered where possible

     Kamaelia/UI/MH/DragHandler.py
     * Issues in dragging resolved.

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/Image.py
     * Allows the user to add in extra arguments controlling the display for
       the image - if possible.
     * Allows for scaling relative to maximum aspect ratio.

     Kamaelia/UI/Pygame/Ticker.py
     * Outline colour now defaults to the bac kground colour if not given
     * Starting of configurability for word playback
     * Abiility to provide a logical position for the ticker on an abstract
       surface.
     * Requests a display using the new "Wait" directive to the scheduler.
       This might actually have similarities to deferred generators in
       twisted. Need to look into.
     * Better modularisation
     * Allows for line oriented tickers - ie reach end of a line, start a
       new line style ticker (rather than subtitle style ticker)

     Kamaelia/Util/Chooser.py
     * ForwardIteratingChooser added.

     Kamaelia/Util/Graphline.py
     * Variety of changes to deal with shutdown of components within the
       graphline better.
     * Key change is the graphline has changed from passive to active. This
       might need revisiting once this API/approach has stablised.

     Kamaelia/Util/PipelineComponent.py
     * Variety of changes to deal with shutdown of components within the
       pipeline better.
     * Key change is the pipeline has changed from passive to active. This
       might need revisiting once this API/approach has stablised.

     Kamaelia/Util/Splitter.py
     * Merge of the test driven rewrite of splitter into here replacing the
       old implementation. Has the same API and passes the old tests, but
       also provdes a pluggable splitter system.

     Kamaelia/Visualisation/Axon/PComponent.py
     * Nicer abbreviation of component names in the introspector

     Kamaelia/Visualisation/PhysicsGraph/ParticleDragger.py

     * Added in facilitiy for querying the current topology the topology
       viewer is displaying.
     * Also sends out a message when a particle is selected.

   * Util/Marhsalling.py and Util/test/test_Marshalling.py added
     Pipeline-able marhsalling/demarshalling components and some basic tests
     Derived from Util/MarshallComponent.py
   * UI/Pygame/VideoOverlay added and PygameDisplay extended to support it
     providing video 'overlay' surface capabilities
   * Codec/RawYUVFramer added to support 'framing' of raw yuv video frames
   * Codec/Dirac added with Dirac video codec encoder and decoder components


0.2.0

Detailed:
   * Util/FilterComponent A component to plug in filter objects to perform and
   sort of filtering or general data processing on a data.  Not yet used by
   the Subtitling related filter classes in Sketches.
   * Util/Splitter added. This component allows a single outbox to be connected
   to many inboxes.
   * Util/test/test_Splitter added to test the above class.
   * Util/LossyConnector added. Component drops messages if the outbox fills.
   * Util/test/test_testSplitter added to test the above class.
   * Util/test directory added.
   * UI/ UI/Pygame directories added
      * The "pygamedisplay" service now exists. Furthermore UI.Pygame.Ticker
        is an example of a component that uses the pygamedisplay to
        demonstrate how to have multiple objects on screen at once, acting
        as if they're the only ones using the screen. This is still at a
        very nascent stage, but should be indicative of future directions.
        One clear thing that arises from this is that "pygamedisplay" is
        currently the most basic one thinkable, and there could be many more
        which effectively act as simple window managers. (However these
        window managers know how to move, scale, position and rotate the
        windows under their control...) (This could mean that these displays
        could be much more candy than even Apple's "Expose" :)

        Clients of the pygamedisplay service get back a raw surface to work
        with :)

   * Add Tools directory at top level -- DONE
      * Introspection viewer gets added here (as a "binary", support code
        goes in main tree)
