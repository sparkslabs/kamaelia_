# This in all likelihood may form the basis of an "Introspecting Scheduler"

The script following shows the basics of how to run IPython as a foreground
thread and Axon as a background thread - allowing live introspection of the
running system.

Example interaction:
michaelsparks:~> ./axonshell.py
In [1]: Axon
Out[1]: <module 'Axon' from
'/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/Axon/__init__.pyc'>

In [2]: Axon.Scheduler.scheduler.run
Out[2]: <Axon.Scheduler.scheduler object at 0x403e3eac>

In [3]: Axon.Scheduler.scheduler.run.threads
Out[3]: 
[<Axon.Postman.postman object at 0x40447ccc>,
 <__main__.Echo object at 0x40441a2c>]

In [4]: Axon.Scheduler.scheduler.run.threads
Out[4]: [<Axon.Postman.postman object at 0x40447ccc>]

(Note that these two show the run queue updating in the background)

In [5]: echo._deliver("Hello World")

In [6]: Echo received:  Hello World
