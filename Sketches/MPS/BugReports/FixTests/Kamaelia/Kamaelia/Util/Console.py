Console Input/Output
====================

The ConsoleEchoer component outputs whatever it receives to the console.

The ConsoleReader component outputs whatever is typed at the console, a line at
a time.



Example Usage
-------------

Whatever it typed is echoed back, a line at a time::

    Pipeline( ConsoleReader(),
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

ConsoleReader is a threaded component. It provides a 'prompt' at which you can
type. Your input is taken, a line a a time, and output to its "outbox" outbox,
with the specified end-of-line character(s) suffixed onto it.

The ConsoleReader component ignores any input on its "inbox" and "control"
inboxes. It does not output anything from its "signal" outbox.

The ConsoleReader component does not terminate.

The ConsoleEchoer component receives data on its "inbox" inbox. Anything it
receives this way is displayed on standard output. All items are passed through
the str() builtin function to convert them to strings suitable for display.

However, if the 'use_repr' argument is set to True during initialization, then
repr() will be used instead of str(). Similarly if a "tag" is provided it's
prepended before the data.

If the 'forwarder' argument is set to True during initialisation, then whatever
is received is not only displayed, but also set on to the "outbox" outbox
(unchanged).

If a producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess message is received on the
ConsoleEchoer component's "control" inbox, then it is sent on to the "signal"
outbox and the component then terminates.
