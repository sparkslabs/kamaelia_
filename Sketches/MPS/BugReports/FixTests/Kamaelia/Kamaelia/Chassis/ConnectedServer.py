Connected Servers
=================

These 'chassis' style components are used to implementing connected servers.
The most common example of this is a server which runs on top of the TCP.
Examples include: a web server, email server, imap server, game protocol
server, etc.

At present, there are two variants of this: *ServerCore* and *SimpleServer*
(You are generally recommended to use ServerCore)

Both of these revolve around building TCP based servers. They handle the
mechanics of creating the listening component, and when new connections come
in, creating instances of your protocol handler components to handle the
connections.

As a result, the primary arguments are the port to listen on and a function
call or class name that when called returns a component for handling this
connection.

Your protocol handler then receives data from a specific client on its inbox
"inbox" and sends data to that same client on its outbox "outbox".

ServerCore passes additional information about the connection to the
function that creates the protocol handler. You are not required to do
anything with that information if you don't need to. 

Aside from that, ServerCore & SimpleServer are used in the same way.
(ServerCore is just an extension, and rationalisation of the older simple
server code).

There is more information here: http://www.kamaelia.org/Cookbook/TCPSystems


Example Usage
-------------

A server using a simple echo protocol, that just echoes back anything sent by
the client. Becase the protocol has no need to know any details of the
connection, the SimpleServer component is used::

    import Axon
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer import SimpleServer

    PORTNUMBER = 12345
    class EchoProtocol(Axon.Component.component):

        def main(self):
            while not self.shutdown():
                yield 1
                if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                    data = self.recv("inbox")
                    self.send(data, "outbox")

        def shutdown(self):
            if self.dataReady("control"):
                msg = self.recv("control")
                return isinstance(msg, Axon.Ipc.producerFinished)

    simpleServer = SimpleServer( protocol = EchoProtocol, port = PORTNUMBER )
    simpleServer.run()

    
Try connecting to this server using the telnet command, and it will echo back
to you every character you type.

A more complex server might need to inform the protocol of the IP address and
port of the client that connects, or the ip address and port at this (the
server end) to which the client has connected. For this, ServerCore is used::

    import Axon
    from Axon.Ipc import shutdownMicroprocess
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.ConnectedServer import ServerCore

    PORTNUMBER = 12345
    class CleverEchoProtocol(Axon.Component.component):

        def main(self):
            welcomeMessage = \
                "Welcome! You have connected to %s on port %d from %s on port %d" % \
                (self.localip, self.localport, self.peer, self.peerport)

            self.send(welcomeMessage, "outbox")
            while not self.shutdown():
                yield 1
                if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                    data = self.recv("inbox")
                    self.send(data, "outbox")

        def shutdown(self):
            if self.dataReady("control"):
                msg = self.recv("control")
                return isinstance(msg, Axon.Ipc.producerFinished)

    myServer = ServerCore( protocol = CleverEchoProtocol, port = PORTNUMBER )
    myServer.run()

Example output when telnetting to this more complex server, assuming both
server and telnet session are running on the same host, and the server is
listening to port number 8081::

    $ telnet localhost 8081
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    Welcome! You have connected to 127.0.0.1 on port 8081 from 127.0.0.1 on port 47316



Why is this useful?
-------------------

Provides a framework for creating generic protocol handlers to deal with
information coming in on a single port (and a single port only). This however
covers a large array of server types.

A protocol handler is simply a component that can receive and send data (as
byte strings) in a particular format and with a particular behaviour - ie.
conforming to a particular protocol. 

Provide this chassis with a factory function to create a component to
handle the protocol. Whenever a client connects a handler component will then be
created to handle communications with that client.

Data received from the client will be sent to the protocol handler component's
"inbox" inbox. To send data back to the client, the protocol handler component
should send it out of its "outbox" outbox.

For the SingleServer component, the factory function takes no arguments. It
should simply return the component that will be used to handle the protocol,
for example::

    def makeNewProtocolHandler():
        return MyProtocolComponent()
        
For the ServerCore component, the factory function must accept the following
arguments (with these names):

- peer  -- the address of the remote endpoint (the client's address)
- peerport  -- the port number of the remote endpoint
  (the port number from which the client connection originated)
- localip  -- the address of the local endpoint (this end of the connection)
- localport  -- the port number of the local endpoint (this end of the connection)
        
For example::

    def makeNewProtocolHandler(peer, peerport, localip, localport):
        print "Debugging: client at address "+peer+" on port "+str(peerport)
        print " ... has connected to address "+localip+" on port "+str(localport)
        return MyProtocolComponent()

Do not activate the component. SingleServer or ServerCore will do this once
the component is wired up.



Writing a protocol handler
--------------------------

A protocol handler component should use its standard inboxes ("inbox" and
"control") and outboxes ("outbox" and "signal") to communicate with client it
is connected to.

- Bytes received from the client will be sent to the "inbox" inbox as a string.

- Send a string out of the "outbox" outbox to send bytes back to the client.

If the connection is closed, a Kamaelia.IPC.socketShutdown message will arrive
at the protocol handler's "control" inbox. If this happens then the connection
should be assumed to have already closed. Any more messages sent will not be 
sent to the client. The protocol handler should react by terminating as soon as
possible.

To cause the connection to close, send a producerFinished or shutdownMicroprocess
message out of the protocol handler's "signal" outbox. As soon as this has been
done, it can be assumed that the connection will be closed as soon as is
practical. The protocol handler will probably also want to terminate at this
point.




How does it work?
-----------------

SimpleServer is based on ServerCore. It simply contains a wrapper around the
protocol handler function that throws away the connection information instead
of passing it in as arguments.

At initialisation the component registers a TCPServer component to listen for
new connections on the specified port.

You supply a factory function that takes no arguments and returns a new
protocol handler component.

When it receives a 'newCSA' message from the TCPServer (via the "_socketactivity"
inbox), the factory function is called to create a new protocol handler. The
protocol handler's "inbox" inbox and "outbox" outbox are wired to the
ConnectedSocketAdapter (CSA) component handling that socket connection, so it can
receive and send data.

If a 'shutdownCSA' message is received (via "_socketactivity") then a
Kamaelia.IPC.socketShutdown message is sent to the protocol handler's
"control" inbox, and both it and the CSA are unwired.

This component does not terminate. It ignores any messages sent to its "control"
inbox.

In practice, this component provides no external connectors for your use.



History
-------

This code is based on the code used for testing the Internet Connection
abstraction layer.



To do
-----

This component currently lacks an inbox and corresponding code to allow it to
be shut down (in a controlled fashion). Needs a "control" inbox that responds to
shutdownMicroprocess messages.
