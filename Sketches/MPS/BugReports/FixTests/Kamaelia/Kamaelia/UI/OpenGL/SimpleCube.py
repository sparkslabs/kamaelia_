=====================
Simple Cube component
=====================

A simple cube for the OpenGL display service.

This component is a subclass of OpenGLComponent and therefore uses the
OpenGL display service.

Example Usage
-------------
Three cubes in different positions with various rotation and sizes::

    Graphline(    
        CUBEC = SimpleCube(position=(0, 0,-12), rotation=(40,90,0), size=(1,1,1)).activate(),
        CUBER = SimpleCube(position=(4,0,-22), size=(2,2,2)).activate(),
        CUBEB = SimpleCube(position=(0,-4,-18), rotation=(0,180,20), size=(1,3,2)).activate(),
        linkages = {}
    ).run()

How does it work?
-----------------
SimpleButton is a subclass of OpenGLComponent (for OpenGLComponent
functionality see its documentation). It overrides draw().

In draw() a simple cube made of 6 quads with different colours is drawn.
