========================
HTTP Server
========================
The fundamental parts of a webserver - an HTTP request parser and a request
handler/response generator. One instance of this component can handle one
TCP connection. Use a SimpleServer or similar component to allow several
concurrent HTTP connections to the server.

Example Usage
-------------

    def createhttpserver():
        return HTTPServer(HTTPResourceGlue.createRequestHandler)

    SimpleServer(protocol=createhttpserver, port=80).run()

This defines a function which creates a HTTPServer instance with 
HTTPResourceGlue.createRequestHandler as the request handler component
creator function. This function is then called by SimpleServer for every
new TCP connection.

How does it work?
-----------------
HTTPServer creates and links to a HTTPParser and HTTPRequestHandler component.
Data received over TCP is forwarded to the HTTPParser and the output of 
HTTPRequestHandler forwarded to the TCP component's inbox for sending.

See HTTPParser (in HTTPParser.py) and HTTPRequestHandler (below) for details
of how these components work.

HTTPServer accepts a single parameter - a request handler function which is
passed onto and used by HTTPRequestHandler to generate request handler 
components. This allows different HTTP server setups to run on different
ports serving completely different content.

========================
HTTP Request Handler
========================
HTTPRequestHandler accepts parsed HTTP requests (from HTTPParser) and outputs
appropriate responses to those requests.

How does it work?
-----------------
HTTPServer creates 2 subcomponents - HTTPParser and HTTPRequestHandler which
handle the processing of requests and the creation of responses respectively.

Both requests and responses are handled in a stepwise manner (as opposed to processing a
whole request or response in one go) to reduce latency and cope well with bottlenecks.

One request handler (self.handler) component is used per request - the particular 
component instance (including parameters, component state) is picked by a function
called createRequestHandler - a function specified by the user. A suitable definition
of this function is available in HTTPResourceGlue.py.

Generally you will have a handler spawned for each new request, terminating after completing
the sending of the response. However, it is also possible to use a 'persistent' component
if you do the required jiggery-pokery to make sure that at any one time this component is
not servicing more than one request simultaenously ('cause it wouldn't work).

What does it support?
---------------------
Components as request handlers (hurrah!).

3 different ways in which the response data (body) can be terminated:

Chunked transfer encoding
*************************
This is the most complex of the 3 ways and was introduced in HTTP/1.1. Its performance is
slightly worse that the other 2 as multiple length-lines have to be added to the data stream.
It is recommended for responses whose size is not known in advance as it allows keep-alive
connections (more than one HTTP request per TCP connection).

Explicit length
*************************
This is the easiest of the 3 ways but requires the length of the response to be known before
it is sent. It uses a header 'Content-Length' to indicate this value.
This method is prefered for any response whose length is known in advance.

Connection: close
*************************
This method closes (or half-closes) the TCP connection when the response is
complete. This is highly inefficient when the client wishes to download several
resources as a new TCP connection must be created and destroyed for each
resource. This method is retained for HTTP/1.0 compatibility.
It is however preferred for responses that do not have a true end,
e.g. a continuous stream over HTTP as the alternative, chunked transfer
encoding, has poorer performance.

The choice of these three methods is determined at runtime by the
characteristics of the first response part produced by the request handler
and the version of HTTP that the client supports
(chunked requires 1.1 or higher).

What may need work?
========================
- HTTP standards-compliance (e.g. handling of version numbers for a start)
- Requests for byte ranges, cache control (though these may be better implemented
    in each request handler)
- Performance tuning (also in HTTPParser)
- Prevent many MBs of data being queued up because TCPClient finds it has a slow
    upload to the remote host
