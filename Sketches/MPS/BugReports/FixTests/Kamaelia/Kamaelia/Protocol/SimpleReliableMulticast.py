=========================
Simple Reliable Multicast
=========================

A pair of Pipelines for encoding (and decoding again) a stream of data such that
is can be transported over an unreliable connection that may lose, duplicate or
reorder data.

These components will ensure that data arrives in the right order and that
duplicates are removed. However it cannot recover lost data.


Example Usage
-------------
Reliably transporting a file over multicast (assuming no packets are lost)::

    Pipeline(RateControlledFileReader("myfile"),
             SRM_Sender(),
             Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 0, "1.2.3.4", 1000),
            ).activate()

On the client::

    class discardSeqnum(component):
        def main(self):
            while 1:
                if self.dataReady("inbox"):
                    (_, data) = self.recv("inbox")
                    self.send(data,"outbox")
    
    Pipeline( Multicast_transceiver("0.0.0.0", 1000, "1.2.3.4", 0)
              SRM_Receiver(),
              discardSeqnum(),
              ConsoleEchoer()
            ).activate()



How does it work?
-----------------

SRM_Sender is a Pipeline of three components:

- Annotator    -- annotates a data stream with sequence numbers
- Framer       -- frames the data
- DataChunker  -- inserts markers between frames

SRM_Receiver is a Pipeline of three components:

- DataDeChunker  -- recovers chunks based on markers
- DeFramer       -- removes framing
- RecoverOrder   -- sorts data by sequence numbers

These components will ensure that data arrives in the right order and that
duplicates are removed. However it cannot recover lost data. But the final
output is (seqnum,data) pairs - so there is enough information for the
receiver to know that data has been lost.

The Annotator component receives data on its "inbox" inbox, and emits
(seqnum, data) tuples on its "outbox" outbox. The sequence numbers start at 1
and increments by 1 for each item.

The Annotator component does not terminate and ignores messages arriving on its
"control" inbox.

See documentation for the other components for details of their design and
behaviour.
