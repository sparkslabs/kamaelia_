ReadFileAdaptor Component
=========================

A simple component that reads data from a file, line by line, or in chunks of
bytes, at a constant rate that you specify.



Example Usage
-------------

Read one line at a time from a text file every 0.2 seconds, outputting to
standard output::

    Pipeline( ReadFileAdaptor("myfile.text", readmode='line', readsize=1, steptime=0.2),
              ConsoleEchoer(),
            ).run()

Read from a file at 1 Kilobits per second, in chunks of 256 bytes and send it
to a server over a TCP network socket::

    Pipeline( ReadFileAdaptor("myfile.data", readmode='bitrate', readsize=1, bitrate=1024*10),
              TCPClient("remoteServer.provider.com", port=1500),
            ).run()



How to use it
-------------

This component takes input from the outside world, and makes
it available on it's outbox. It can take input from the following data sources:

   * A specific file
   * The output of a command
   * stdin

In all cases, it can make the data available in the following modes:
   * On a line by line basis
   * On a "block by block" basis.
   * At an attempted (not guaranteed) bit rate.
   * If at a bit rate, also a "frame rate". (eg if you want 1Mbit/s, do you
     want that as 1x1Mbit block, 4x250Kbit blocks, 25x 40Kbit blocks, or
     what, each second?
   * A "step time" to define how often to read  0 == as often/fast as
     possible 0.1 == every 0.1 seconds, 0.5 = every 0.5 seconds, 2 = every
     2 seconds etc.

Clearly some of these modes are mutually exclusive!

Once ReadFileAdaptor has finished reading from the file, it finishes by sending
a producerFinished() message out of its "signal" outbox, then immediately
terminates.

There is no way to tell ReadFileAdaptor to prematurely stop. It ignores all
messages sent to its "control" inbox.



To do
-----

The default standalone behaviour is to read in from stdin, and dump to stdout
in a teletype fashion the data it recieves. It _may_ gain command line parsing
at some point, which would be wacky. (And probably a good way of initialising
components - useful standalone & externally)

XXX TODO: Signal EOF on an external output to allow clients to destroy us.
XXX Implement the closeDown method - ideally add to the component
XXX framework.

class ReadFileAdaptor(component):
   """\
   An instance of this class is a read file adaptor component. It's
   constructor arguments are all optional. If no arguments are provided,
   then the default is to read from stdin, one line at a time, as fast as
   possible. Note that this will cause the outbox to fill at the same rate
   as stdin can provide data. (Be wary of memory constraints this will
   cause!)
   
   Arguments & meaning:
      * filename="filename" - the name of the file to read. If you want stdin,
        do not provide a filename! If you want the output from a command,
        also leave this blank...
      * command="command" - the name of the command you want the
        output from. Leave the filename blank if you use this!
      * readmode - possible values:
         - "bitrate" - read at a specified bitrate.
         - "line"    - read on a line by line basis
         - "block"   - read the file on a block by block basis.
      * If bitrate mode is set, you should set bitrate= to your
        desired bitrate (unless you want 64Kbit/s), and chunkrate=
        to your desired chunkrate (unless you want 24 fps). You are
        expected to be able to handle the bit rate you request!
      * If block mode is set then you should set readsize (size of the
        block in bytes), and steptime (how often you want bytes). If
        steptime is set to zero, you will read blocks at the speed the
        source device can provide them. (be wary of memory constraints)
   
   After setting the ReadFileAdaptor in motion, you can then hook it into
   your linkages like any other component.
