WSGI Handler
=============

NOTE:  This is experimental software.

This is the WSGI handler for ServerCore.  It will wait on the
HTTPParser to transmit the body in full before proceeding.  Thus, it is probably
not a good idea to use any WSGI apps requiring a lot of large file uploads (although
it could theoretically function fairly well for that purpose as long as the concurrency
level is relatively low).

For more information on WSGI, what it is, and to get a general overview of what
this component is intended to adapt the ServerCore to do, see one of the following
links:

* http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ (PEP 333)
* http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/ (WsgiStart wiki)
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface (Wikipedia article on WSGI)

-------------
Dependencies
-------------

This component depends on the wsgiref module, which is included with python 2.5.
Thus if you're using an older version, you will need to install it before using
this component.  

The easiest way to install wsgiref is to use easy_install, which may be downloaded
from http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall .  You may then install
wsgiref using the command "sudo easy_install wsgiref" (without the quotes of course).

Please note that Kamaelia Publish includes wsgiref.

-----------------------------
How do I use this component?
-----------------------------

The easiest way to use this component is to use the WsgiHandler factory function
that is included in Factory.py in this package.  That method has URL handling that
will route a URL to the proper place.  There is also a SimpleWsgiHandler that may
be used if you only want to support one application object.  For more information
on how to use these functions, please see Factory.py.  Also please note that both
of these factory functions are made to work with ServerCore/SimpleServer.  Here is
an example of how to create a simple WSGI server:

from Kamaelia.Protocol.HTTP import HTTPProtocol
from Kamaelia.Experimental.Wsgi.Factory import WsgiFactory  # FIXME: Docs are broken :-(

WsgiConfig = {
    'wsgi_ver' : (1, 0),
    'server_admin' : 'Jason Baker',
    'server_software' : 'Kamaelia Publish'
}

url_list = [ #Note that this is a list of dictionaries.  Order is important.
    {
        'kp.regex' : 'simple',
        'kp.import_path' : 'Kamaelia.Apps.Wsgi.Apps.Simple',
        'kp.app_obj' : 'simple_app',
    }
    {
        'kp.regex' : '.*',  #The .* means that this is a 404 handler
        'kp.import_path' : 'Kamaelia.Apps.Wsgi.Apps.ErrorHandler',
        'kp.app_obj' : 'application',
    }
]

routing = [['/', WsgiFactory(WsgiConfig, url_list)]]

ServerCore(
    protocol=HTTPProtocol(routing),
    port=8080,
    socketOptions=(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)).run()

------------------
Internal overview
------------------

request object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that certain WSGI applications will require configuration
data from the urls file.  If you use the WsgiFactory to run this
handler, all options specified in the urls file will be put into
the environment variable with a kp. in front of them.  

For example, the 'regex' entry in a urls file would go into the
environ dictionary like this if it was set to 'simple':

{
    ...
    'kp.regex' : 'simple',
    ...
}

wsgi.input
~~~~~~~~~~~

PEP 333 requires that the WSGI environ dictionary also contain a file-like object
that holds the body of the request.  Currently, the WsgiHandler will wait for the
full request before starting the application (which is not optimal behavior).  If
the method is not PUT or POST, the handler will use a pre-made null-file object that
will always return empty data.  This is an optimization to lower peak memory usage
and to speed things up.

WsgiConfig
~~~~~~~~~~~

The WsgiHandler requires a WsgiConfig dictonary for general configuration info. The
following items are required to be defined:

* wsgi_ver: the WSGI version as a Tuple.  You want to use (1, 0)
* server_admin: the name and/or email address of the server's administrator
* server_software: The software and/or software version that runs the server

FIXME:  It would be nice if the WsgiConfig were made into an object rather than a
dictionary.
