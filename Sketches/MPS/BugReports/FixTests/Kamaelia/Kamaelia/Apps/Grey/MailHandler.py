=========================
Abstract SMTP Mailer Core
=========================

This component effectively forms the skeleton of an SMTP server. It expects
an SMTP client to connect and send various SMTP requests to it. This basic
SMTP Mailer Core however, does not actually do anything in response to any
of the SMTP commands it expects.

Each SMTP command is actually given a dummy callback which more customised
SMTP protocol handlers are expected to override. Beyond this, this component
is expected to be used as a protocol handler for ServerCore.

Fundamentally, this component handles the command/response structure of SMTP
fairly directly, but expects the brains of the protocol to be implemented by
a more intelligent subclass.



Example Usage
-------------

Whilst this will work to a minimal extent::

    ServerCore(protocol=MailHandler, port=1025)

This will not actually form a very interesting SMTP, nor SMTP compliant,
server since whilst it will tell you commands it doesn't understand, it will
not do anything interesting.

You are as noted expected to subclass MailHandler. For a better example
of how to subclass MailHandler you are suggested to look at
Kamaelia.Apps.ConcreteMailHandler.ConcreteMailHandler



Note
----

This component is not complete - you are expected to subclass it to finish
it off as you need. Specifically it does not implement the following:

 - It does not enforce "this command followed by that command"
 - It does not actually do anything with any DATA a client sends you
 - It neither performs local mail delivery nor proxying - you'd need to implement this yourself.



How does it work?
-----------------

The component is expected to be connected to a client TCP connection by
ServerCore, such that messages from the network arrive on inbox "inbox", and
outgoing messages get sent to outbox "outbox"

The component will terminate if any of these is true:

 - The client breaks the connection
 - One of the methods sets self.breakConnection to True.
 - If a "socketShutdown" message arrives on inbox "control"

The main() method divides the connection into effectively two main states:

 - accepting random commands prior to getting a DATA command
 - accepting the email during a DATA command

SMTP commands are specifically dispatched to a particular handler for that
command. In this component none of the handlers do anything interesting.



Configuration
-------------

The abstract mailer supports some basic config settings:

 - logfile - path/filename where requests should get logged
 - debuglogfile - path/filename to where the debug log file should do.



Methods you are expected to override
------------------------------------

Whilst you are probably better off subclassing ConcreteMailHandler, you will
probably need to override the following methods in a subclass if you
subclass MailHandler directly.

 - handleConnect(self)
 - handleHelo(self,command)
 - handleEhlo(self,command)
 - handleMail(self,command)
 - handleRcpt(self,command)
 - handleData(self,command)
 - handleQuit(self,command)
 - handleRset(self,command)
 - handleNoop(self,command)
 - handleVrfy(self,command)
 - handleHelp(self,command)
 - logResult(self)
 - handleDisconnect(self)
