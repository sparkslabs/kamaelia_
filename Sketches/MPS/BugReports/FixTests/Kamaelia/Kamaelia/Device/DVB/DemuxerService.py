DVB-T (Digital Terrestrial TV) Demuxing Service
===============================================

A component for demultiplexing packets by packet ID (PID) from DVB/MPEG
transport streams. Provides this as a service, to which other components can
subscribe as clients, requesting to receive packets with certain PIDs.



Example Usage
-------------

See Kamaelia.Device.DVB.Receiver for examples of use.



How does it work?
-----------------

DemuxerService takes MPEG transport stream packets, sent to its "inbox" inbox
and determines the packet ID (PID) of each, then distributes them to all
clients who are after packets with that PID.

To be a client, send a 'ADD' or 'REMOVE' message to the "request" inbox,
requesting to be sent (or no longer be sent) packets with particular PIDs, and
specifying the inbox to which you want the packets to be sent. The
format of these requests is::

    ("ADD",    [pid, pid, ...], (dest_component, dest_inboxname))
    ("REMOVE", [pid, pid, ...], (dest_component, dest_inboxname))
    
DemuxerService will automatically do the wiring or unwiring needed to ensure the
packets you have requested get sent to the inbox you specified.

Send an 'ADD' request, and you will immediately start receiving packets with
those PIDs. Send a 'REMOVE' request and you will shortly no longer receive
packets with the PIDs you specify. Note that you may still receive some packets
after your 'REMOVE' request.

DemuxerService sends its own identical format 'ADD' and 'REMOVE' requests out
of its "pid_request" outbox. Wire this to the source of MPEG transport stream
packets, if that source needs to know what PIDs it is expected to provide.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to the "control" inbox. The message will be forwarded on out of
the "signal" outbox just before termination.

When it terminates, this component will unwire itself from all clients to which
it has been sending packets.
