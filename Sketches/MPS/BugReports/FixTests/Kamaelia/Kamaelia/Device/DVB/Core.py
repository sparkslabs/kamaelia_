SimpleDVB-T (Digital Terrestrial TV) Tuner
==========================================

DVB_Multiplex tunes to the specified DVB-T multiplex and outputs received MPEG
Transport Stream packets that have a PID in the list of PIDs specified.

If you need to change which PIDs you receive at runtime, consider using
Kamaelia.Device.DVB.Tuner



Example Usage
-------------

Receiving PIDs 600 and 601 from MUX 1 broadcast from Crystal Palace in the UK
(this should, effectively, receive the video and audio for the channel
'BBC ONE')::
  
    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
    from Kamaelia.Device.DVB.Core import DVB_Multiplex
    from Kamaelia.File.Writing import SimpleFileWriter
    import dvb3.frontend

    feparams = {
        "inversion" : dvb3.frontend.INVERSION_AUTO,
        "constellation" : dvb3.frontend.QAM_16,
        "code_rate_HP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
        "code_rate_LP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
    }

    Pipeline( DVB_Multiplex(505.833330, [600,601], feparams),
              SimpleFileWriter("BBC ONE.ts"),
            ).run()

Receive and record the whole multiplex (all pids)::

    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Pipeline import Pipeline
    from Kamaelia.Device.DVB.Core import DVB_Multiplex
    from Kamaelia.File.Writing import SimpleFileWriter
    import dvb3.frontend

    feparams = {
        "inversion" : dvb3.frontend.INVERSION_AUTO,
        "constellation" : dvb3.frontend.QAM_16,
        "code_rate_HP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
        "code_rate_LP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
    }

    Pipeline( DVB_Multiplex(505.833330, [0x2000], feparams),
              SimpleFileWriter("BBC ONE.ts"),
            ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

DVB_Multiplex tunes, using the specified tuning parameters to a DVB-T
transmitted multiplex.

It will output received transport stream packets out of its "outbox" outbox for
those packets with a PID in the list of PIDs specified at initialization.

Most DVB tuner devices understand a special packet ID of 0x2000 to request the
entire transport stream of all packets with all IDs. Specify a list containing
only this PID to receive the whole transport stream.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to the "control" inbox. The message will be forwarded on out of
the "signal" outbox just before termination.



============================================
SimpleDVB-T (Digital Terrestrial TV) Demuxer
============================================

DVB_Demuxer take in MPEG transport stream packets and routes them to different
outboxes, as specified in a mapping table.

If you need to change which PIDs you receive at runtime, consider using
Kamaelia.Device.DVB.DemuxerService.



Example Usage
-------------

Receiving PIDs 600 and 601 from MUX 1 broadcast from Crystal Palace in the UK
(this should, effectively, receive the video and audio for the channel
'BBC ONE') and write them to separate files, plus also to a combined file. Plus
also record PIDS 610 and 611 (audio and video for 'BBC TWO') to a fourth file::

    from Kamaelia.Chassis.Graphline import Graphline
    from Kamaelia.Device.DVB.Core import DVB_Multiplex
    from Kamaelia.Device.DVB.Core import DVB_Demuxer
    from Kamaelia.File.Writing import SimpleFileWriter
    import dvb3.frontend

    feparams = {
        "inversion" : dvb3.frontend.INVERSION_AUTO,
        "constellation" : dvb3.frontend.QAM_16,
        "code_rate_HP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
        "code_rate_LP" : dvb3.frontend.FEC_3_4,
    }

    Graphline(
        RECV   = DVB_Multiplex(505.833330, [600,601, 610,611], feparams),
        DEMUX  = DVB_Demuxer( { 600 : ["outbox","video"],
                                601 : ["outbox","audio"],
                                610 : ["two"],
                                611 : ["two"] } ),
        REC_A  = SimpleFileWriter("audio.ts"),
        REC_V  = SimpleFileWriter("video.ts"),
        REC_AV = SimpleFileWriter("audio_and_video.ts"),
        REC_2  = SimpleFileWriter("audio_and_video2.ts"),
        
        linkages = { ("RECV",  "outbox")  : ("DEMUX",  "inbox"),
        
                     ("DEMUX", "outbox") : ("REC_AV", "inbox"),
                     ("DEMUX", "audio")  : ("REC_A",  "inbox"),
                     ("DEMUX", "video")  : ("REC_V",  "inbox"),
                     
                     ("DEMUX", "two")    : ("REC_2",  "inbox"),
                   }
    ).run()



How does it work?
-----------------

DVB_Demuxer takes MPEG transport stream packets, sent to its "inbox" inbox
and determines the packet ID (PID) of each, then distributes them to different
outboxes according to a mapping dictionary specified at intialization.

The dictionary maps individual PIDs to lists of outbox names (the outboxes to
which packets with that given PID should be sent), for example::
  
    {
      600 : ["outbox","video"],
      601 : ["outbox","audio"],
      610 : ["two"],
      611 : ["two"]
    }

This example mapping specified that packets with 600 and 601 should be sent to
the "outbox" outbox. Packets with PID 600 should also be sent to the "video"
outbox and packets with PID 601 should also be sent to the "audio" outbox.
Finally, packets with PIDs 610 and 611 should b sent to the "two" outbox.

The relevant outboxes are automatically created.

If a packet arrives with a PID not featured in the mapping table, that packet
will be discarded.

As in the above example, a packet with a given PID can be mapped to more than
one destination outbox. It will be sent to all outboxes to which it is mapped.

Packets which have their 'error' or 'scrambled' flag bits set will be discarded.

This component will terminate if a shutdownMicroprocess or producerFinished
message is sent to the "control" inbox. The message will be forwarded on out of
the "signal" outbox just before termination.
