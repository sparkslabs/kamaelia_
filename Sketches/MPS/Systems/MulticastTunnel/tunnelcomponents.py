# Sketches of components needed for joining multicast islands together.
#
# Issue with the tunnel endpoint is any data recieved isn't detupled before
# being sent, which probably isn't what we want.
#
# If the code looks familiar, it's essentially the code from examples 3 and 4
#
# ==UNTESTED== (and expected non-working)
#

#
# First the tunneled multicast group and port
#
tunnelled_group = "224.168.2.9"
tunnelled_port = 2500

# TCP Server to multicast components
#
# This needs work - largely because whilst it detunnels data correctly, 
# I'm pretty certain it's not tunneling data from the outside world
# correctly.

# Multicast to TCP Client components
#
# This looks correct, but needs validation.
#
# Listens on a multicast address, sends all data received over a TCP
# connection to an endpoint. Any data received over the TCP connection is
# retransmitted over the multicast group. This essentially forms a NAT for
# the multicast session.
#
# This will be more generally useful as software we can just give people for
# bypassing the lack of multicast deployment over the internet. (Hmm...
# Thinking about it, this also relieves the more general issues with routing
# since explicit network joins in this manner mean that not everyone needs WAN
# based multicast enabled)
#
# In a fun way this will also allow companies to join a BBC multicast
# group...
