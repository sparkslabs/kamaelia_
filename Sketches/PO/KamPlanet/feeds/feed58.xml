    I wrote this script to accomplish the following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; use an external SMTP email server&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Use Python&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Not use the svn.fs packages form subversion&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Allow configuration on a reg-ex pattern&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Send the logs and diffs in the email&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; allow simply dropping the script into svn/hooks/post-commit&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, I tried the contrib scripts from subversion. They were a little too complicated and had dependencies I did not want to install on a shared server.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wrote this script to accomplish the goals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some links to the script:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=http://kazavoo.com/misc/post-commit&gt;Plain source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=http://kazavoo.com/misc/post-commit.html&gt;Colorized source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or here is the source inline: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/blog/index.php?/archives/73-Send-Custom-Email-from-Subversion-Commits-Tutorial.html#extended&quot;&gt;Continue reading &quot;Send Custom Email from Subversion Commits Tutorial&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;(I also posted this question to the ChiPy List)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I posted the video and will be reposting a better quality version soon  &lt;br /&gt;
if some of you can help me work out the details (Disclaimer: I am  &lt;br /&gt;
totally new to recording and publishing video). If you can&#039;t wait here  &lt;br /&gt;
is the first try:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;embed style=&quot;width:400px; height:326px;&quot; id=&quot;VideoPlayback&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; src=&quot;http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-906354546937878632&amp;hl=en&quot; flashvars=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/embed&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-906354546937878632&quot;&gt;Link to Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Admittedly, the quality is poor on my first try.  The aspect ratio I  &lt;br /&gt;
shot in was different than how I posted to Google Video--so its skewed  &lt;br /&gt;
to letterbox.  The video looks and sounds much better on my computer  &lt;br /&gt;
before I post. I shot the video in HD widescreen and went to mp4 the  &lt;br /&gt;
way the google video suggests in its FAQ. I am not sure I like the  &lt;br /&gt;
quality of any of the videos on a hosted web viewer solution versus  &lt;br /&gt;
the pod-casts I view through iTunes.  But, I am also concerned if  &lt;br /&gt;
other pod-cast readers are readily available (Linux? Windows?) so that  &lt;br /&gt;
all of you viewing can use any feed I produce.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If everyone can use this format, I would like to explore the option of  &lt;br /&gt;
using the mv4 format in the form of a podcast. IE, it would be nice to  &lt;br /&gt;
have a RSS feed just for meetings.  I did see a Python package called  &lt;br /&gt;
PyRSS2Gen http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html.  Does  &lt;br /&gt;
anybody know the correlation between the content of the RSS entry for  &lt;br /&gt;
video and the example used on this website? For instance, is the  &lt;br /&gt;
content of each entry just html pointing to the video data as a  &lt;br /&gt;
hyperlink? What do I need to consider if I want to optimize for  &lt;br /&gt;
devices like the iPhone and iPod?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, the video is kind of large in the mv4 or mp4 formats. Its like  &lt;br /&gt;
around 400-600Meg for 1 hour with the compressions I have available on  &lt;br /&gt;
my platform. Also, the video when digitized from the HD format takes  &lt;br /&gt;
60 Gigs. So, I do not really want to save the original data on disk.   &lt;br /&gt;
Also, I do not really want to host the data in the mv4 or mp4 formats  &lt;br /&gt;
on the ChiPy Server. Its just a lot of disk space and bandwidth. What  &lt;br /&gt;
other options do I have. Can I use a file hosting service in  &lt;br /&gt;
conjunction with a link from a RSS feed I do host on ChiPy Server?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Someone else suggested a torrent. I am not sure how this works either.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like I mentioned before, I am a novice and do want to continue  &lt;br /&gt;
recording and sharing this information online. Any suggestions or  &lt;br /&gt;
advice? I am looking forward to learning but do not know where to start.

    After taking some time off from Django, I have returned and am happy with what I found--in particular &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/newforms/&quot; &gt;newforms&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The thing I like about Django is it seems to continue to move forward despite some drastic swings in loyal users and a API changes.  When a open source project starts to get some attention, I have often found that the projects goal get lost in the clutter by persons involved with mixed motives. The project tear apart in a way not repairable. The project becomes a sort of a Humpty Dumpty. I can tell that by newforms the project continues on track. Yes, its anouther big change for those who can&#039;t wait for 1.0, but they seemed to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;newforms&quot; is like the removal of a thorn from Django side.  The old way of handling forms was one of the things I did not like about Django. It seemed too clumsy. Nevertheless, the newforms method of modeling the intent of a form and then providing a form in table or list item format is fabulous. newforms method of self generation from models is brilliant. The error handling and the round tripping of data is great. &quot;newforms&quot; provides the instant gratification I needed for the one-off project I had to produce under time constraints.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I have been shopping for a more IDE-like Python programming environment.  I typically have stuck with VIM. But now I have been working with wxPython and more event-driven stuff where I really want things like: breakpoints, debugging, code-complete, code-folding, and other IDE niceties.  Its not that I can not accomplish the same thing with VIM, its that it was much easier with Komodo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can not say its been an easy, however. So far...&lt;br /&gt;

    Trolling for Python news, I ran across this article &lt;a href=&quot;http://pr-gb.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12244&amp;Itemid=9&quot;&gt;Make Your Pilgrimage to Python Bootcamp at the Big Nerd Ranch, November 5-9, 2007&lt;/a&gt;. It states that the class teaches, &quot;using Python to process data, creating links between existing applications, and creating complex mission critical applications involving concurrency, network programming, and distributed systems.&quot;  Better yet, the class will be thought by David Beazley, one of the great Python Guru&#039;s also from Chicago. Seems to be a really good choice for &lt;a href=&quot;http://bignerdranch.com/classes/python.shtml&quot;&gt;Big Nerd Ranch Class.&lt;/a&gt;  Here is the complete press release:&lt;br /&gt;

    This is partially in response to Chris&#039;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.lonelylion.com/2007/03/30/why-python-3k-shouldnt-be-ruby-and-a-mention-of-erlang/&quot;&gt;Why Python 3k Shouldn’t Be Ruby (and a mention of Erlang)&lt;/a&gt; and my investigation on what I see Python 3000 as being, in plain English.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, none of the changes in Python 3000 are so Earth-shattering that one should fear being taken in the wrong direction. As part of the Python tradition, the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) process is in full effect for Python 3000. I believe its name, &quot;Python 3000,&quot; comes from the fact that the PEP index has all Python 3k proposals between 3000-3999.  I have highlighted some of these below for others to comment. Consider this my executive-and-check-if-I-am-understanding-things-summary. Likewise, if you take his short list as the major changes, along with the arrangement of items in the std lib, there really is not too much here to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;

    The &lt;a href=&quot;http://chipy.org/SnakesOnApples&quot; &gt;Snakes on Apples&lt;/a&gt; meeting went well. Attendance was just under 30, from what I could tell.  Good for this time of year and for a topic that may not interest everyone. About half were regulars, 1/4 in from out of town to attend the C4, and others were new or students from UIC.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://farmdev.com/&quot; &gt;Kumar McMillan&lt;/a&gt; gave a detailed presentation on &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot; &gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;. I talked about my new &lt;a href=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/AdrBook2Gmail/&quot; &gt;AdrBook2Gmail&lt;/a&gt; plug in written in Python.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/blog/index.php?/archives/52-ChiPy-August-Roundup-TextMate,-AdrBook2Gmail.html#extended&quot;&gt;Continue reading &quot;ChiPy August Roundup: TextMate, AdrBook2Gmail&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

    I have released the sources (&lt;a href=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/AdrBook2Gmail/&quot;  title=&quot;AdrBook2Gmail&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;) for the my AdrBook2Gmail plugin. Its goal is to plug into Mac OSX address book to sync to and from gmail contacts in an intelligent manner.  A gmail account and a modern Mac is required. There also exists a installer if you simply want to test--but be warned its not fully functional or even close. This project is still very much in development right now. So this is a alpha / pre-alpha release. A new BSD style license has already been applied.  I will present on this project at tonights &lt;a href=&quot;http://chipy.org&quot;  title=&quot;Chicago Python User Group&quot;&gt;ChiPy&lt;/a&gt; meeting tonight. I am open to hearing suggestions you may have on where to take this next. I think the concept is good, but the needs some work; aka, finished.  Also, the data structures describing what consists of a Contact are realized on both ends. Likewise, the way a contact may mash together, is fairly well along. Let me know your thoughts.

    For the three or so projects I have been putting off until after finals, I finally can say I may be able to consider thinking about actually finishing these.  So, to start I am scraping off the blog-sphere trying to get caught up on the latest and greatest. For the website I have hesitated publishing, yeah the one concerning real estate search and rescue I had everyone so excited about, we talked about adding AJAX functionality to the UI.  So, now, what is the JavaFX and should I be looking at JavaFX instead of AJAX? And, finally, when are we coming out with PythonFX?

    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenoss.com/&quot;  title=&quot;Project home page&quot;&gt;Zenoss Core&lt;/a&gt; is SF project of the month. Wow. This is nice to see. Because: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am getting tired of WebMin&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its written in Python&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&#039;s something liked by Sys Admin people and its not written Perl &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its broken up into layers user, data, and collection (presumably MVC like)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it looks all slick and web2.0 like&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its written in Python&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although, things I am note as sure about: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it proven&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it as robust&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why zope&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why only mysql&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it as secure (recalling recent WebMin exploits)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blame myself, really. This is for this month&#039;s ChiPy meeting that never happened. It like the second ChiPy meeting we canceled since May 2005 or something like that. I posted to the forum we should instead just meet at a pub, but no takers. I guess everyone is too busy planning our bid for PyCon or playing with their new toys &lt;img src=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/blog/templates/default/img/emoticons/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:-)&quot; style=&quot;display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;&quot; class=&quot;emoticon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead, I thought I would grab the oldest version of Python I could find, and see if it would compile on my Mac OSX 10.4.5. Yep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ ./Python/python &lt;br /&gt;Python 1.0.1 (Jan 11 2007)&lt;br /&gt;Copyright 1991-1994 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;hi&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1+1&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1/0&lt;br /&gt;Traceback (innermost last):&lt;br /&gt;  File &amp;quot;&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, line 1&lt;br /&gt;ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo&lt;/pre&gt;See, its not that I have no life, its that I schedule time for not having a life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/blog/index.php?/archives/30-Life-without-ChiPy.html#extended&quot;&gt;Continue reading &quot;Life without ChiPy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://subversion.tigris.org/&quot;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt; for my own home consulting business.  This brings a whole new feeling to the already great version control system  over the other repositories I have used with dozens of committers. I decided to make a little hack that  ties together :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Version Control (SVN)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Project Management (ICAL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Billing (email log)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 0px none ; float: right; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; width: 335px; height: 169px;&quot; src=&quot;uploads/SVNICAL.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in Python, course! My little nifty script source found below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kazavoo.com/blog/index.php?/archives/28-SVN-to-ICAL.html#extended&quot;&gt;Continue reading &quot;SVN to ICAL&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
