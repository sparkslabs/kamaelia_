1. Required packages
--------------------

The following packages are required for running KamPlanet:

 * Kamaelia :-)
 * feedparser
      - tested with version: 4.1 (included in "libs" dir)
      - home page: http://www.feedparser.org/
 * htmltmpl
      - tested with version: 1.22 (included in "libs" dir)
      - home page: http://htmltmpl.sourceforge.net/

 * mocker (optional)
      - Only needed for running the tests
      - tested with version: 0.10-1 (included in "libs" dir)
      - home page: http://labix.org/mocker

2. Running KamPlanet
--------------------

  2.1 Configuring KamPlanet
  -------------------------

  (TODO, for now take a look the kamaelia-config.xml file, it 
  is commented and so on)

  2.2 Running KamPlanet
  ---------------------

  In order to run the app, you only need to execute:

  $ python KamPlanet.py

  It will generate two files, one with the feed of the planet and the
  other with the HTML result of the planet. The path of these files
  is defined in the configuration file. If you want to use other 
  configuration file than the default one (it uses the name 
  "kamaelia-config.xml" by default), you can pass it as an argument:

  $ python -c /path/to/another/xml

  In order to retrieve debugging information about which microprocesses
  are still running, you can also turn the introspector on:
  
  $ python -i

  Finally, you can activate a real time "debugger" by passing a port as
  follows:

  $ python -p 12345

  This will start in a daemon thread a socket server which will listen
  on that port in localhost. If you connect to that port in localhost,
  you get a Python shell. From this Python shell you can access to any
  module in the running application, you can check the state of the
  classes, you can modify it, you can create new classes / functions
  and change them while the process is still running, etc. Only useful
  if debugging becomes really difficult.

3. Running KamPlanet tests
--------------------------

  $ python runTests.py 
  .......
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 7 tests in 0.466s
  
  OK
  $

  Optionally, you can use the first argument to see a GUI version. It 
  requires unittestgui installed:

  $ python runTests.py gui
  (a new Tkinter window pops up and you can run the tests)
