"""\
This component waits for messages and sends the appropriate response. Each incoming message
is processed into the format (type, body), where "type" is associated with a response. The appropriate
response is pulled out from an internal dictionary and sent out through "outbox".

The response is stored in the form of a function and a response-type. The function transforms "body".
Then a generic function takes "response-type" and the result of the first function and returns the
final form of the reply, which is sent out to "outbox".

Responder supports a "sendout" method, which takes as mandatory arguments a key and a body. It
runs the key and body through the aforementioned generic function, and sends the result off to "outbox".
