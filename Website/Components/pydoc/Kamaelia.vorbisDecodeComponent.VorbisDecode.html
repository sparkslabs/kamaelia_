<h1>Kamaelia.vorbisDecodeComponent.VorbisDecode</h1>
<h2>class VorbisDecode(Axon.Component.component)</h2>

<p>VorbisDecode() -&gt; new VorbisDecoder</p>
<p>A Vorbis decoder accepts data on its inbox &quot;inbox&quot;, as would be read
from an ogg vorbis file, decodes it and sends on the decompressed data on
out of its outbox &quot;outbox&quot;. It doesn't provide any further information
at this stage, such as bitrate, or any other frills.</p>
<p><strong>Requires</strong> libvorbissimple and python bindings (see kamaelia downloads)</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>A simple player:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
pipeline(
    ReadFileAdaptor(&quot;somefile.ogg&quot;),
    VorbisDecode(),
    AOAudioPlaybackAdaptor(),
).run()
</pre>
<p>This component expects to recieve OGG VORBIS data as you would
get from a .ogg file containing vorbis data. (rather than raw
vorbis data)</p>
<h4>Inboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   control : Receiving a message here causes component shutdown
<li>   inbox : Ogg wrapped vorbis data
</ul>
<h4>Outboxes</h4>
<ul><li>   outbox : As data is decompresessed it is sent to this outbox
<li>   signal : When the component shuts down, it sends on a producerFinished message
</ul>
<h2>Methods defined here</h2>

[[boxright][[include][file=Components/MethodNote.html][croptop=1][crop
bottom=1] ] ]
<h3>__init__(self)</h3>
<p>x.__init__(...) initializes x; see x.__class__.__doc__ for signature</p>
<h3>main(self)</h3>
<p>This contains no user serviceable parts :-)</p>
<p>Theory of operation is simple. It simply repeatedly asks the decoder
object for audio. That decoded audio is sent to the component's outbox.
If the decoder object responds with RETRY, the component retries.
If the decoder object responds with NEEDDATA, the component waits
for data on any inbox until some is available (from an inbox)</p>
