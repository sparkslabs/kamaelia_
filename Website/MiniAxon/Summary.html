<p>This tutorial has hopefully helped you build a core component system based on Kamaelia's Axon. It should be clear as well from this that the core of Kamaelia is actually quite small. We've found a number of aspects which we can optimise, add in syntactic sugar, and we're discovering that certain facilities are needed, and can be useful. However the raw core is simple - it's about generators communicating with inboxes and outboxes, and then building interesting systems on top of that.</p>
<p>The next step we'd normally recommend at this point is to build some interesting systems. Some exercises which will hopefully be helpful will appear as time progresses.</p>
